    "content": " While Active Customers in Product Commerce increased both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, Active Customers in our Eats offering declined, due in part to a minus 11% contraction quarter-over-quarter in the overall online food delivery segment after the loosening of COVID restrictions. As Bom noted, we continue to see strong growth in our net revenue per active customer, increasing 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, as our customers continue to deepen their engagement with our services. On your first question, as we noted earlier, our revenue per Active Customers grew on a constant currency basis 20% year-over-year and continues -- customer spend continues to compound at a fast rate because we are seeing growth and strong adoption across many categories and offerings. And on your second question, the $200 million investment in Developing Offerings, we continue to invest, as I mentioned, in long-term opportunities that may not yield revenue growth in the short term because we're excited about the opportunity to capture spend in fintech and video and international, for example, that help us expand the TAM over the long term."
