    "content": " Specific to the second quarter, our revenues increased 18% to $841 million and we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, an increase of 26% over the prior quarter. While we have fixed energy prices in France this year, in May we received notification from our energy provider that the French government decided to increase the relative portion of RN, which lowers our realized cost of energy, and we received a net benefit of approximately $31 million this quarter. During Q2, the overall impact of energy prices in Spain was positive $5.7 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as our average realized cost of energy in Spain improved by approximately 15%. In terms of de-leveraging, we repurchased approximately $90 million of face value of the 9.375 senior notes in the open market during the month of June at an average price of $101, and subsequent to quarter end, we successfully redeemed the entire $60 million of our 9% super senior notes in July, further supporting our priorities in terms of gross debt reduction. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
