    "content": " While the second half of 2022 was slower than expected, we want to emphasize that we begin 2023 with a supply constrained potash market, where an estimated 25% to 30% of global 2023 potash production is still coming from higher risk regions in Eastern Europe, which is showing minimal signs and deescalation. Our 2022 average net realized sales price for potash was $713 per ton, up over 100% compared to the prior year. As Bob noted, the key driver behind our strong performance continues to be high prices for potash and Trio and in the fourth quarter our average net sales price for potash was $693 per ton, while for Trio, it averaged $461 per ton. In our potash segment, our fourth quarter 2022 sales volumes totaled 50,000 tons while our production totaled 106,000 tons, which compares to a year ago figures of 61,000 tons and 86,000 tons respectively. In terms of potash guidance for the first quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we expect Q1 sales volumes in the range of 80,000 to 90,000 tons with an average net realized sales price $470 to $480 per ton. In our Trio segment, our fourth quarter of 2022 sales volumes totaled 28,000 tons, down from 48,000 tons in the prior year period as buyers remain reluctant to commit to volumes in anticipation of declining prices. As for Trio guidance, we expect first quarter 2023 sales volumes will fall in the range of 55,000 to 65,000 tons, with an average net realized sales price between $335 and $345 per ton."
