    "content": " With that out of the way, in the first quarter of 2022, the trend of high prices certainly across most fertilizer products continue, and we deliver an average net realized price, which was $703 per ton for potash and $469 per ton for Trio, which represent respective increases of approximately 150% -- and 100% compared to the first quarter of 2021. On a consolidated basis, in the first quarter, Intrepid's revenue of approximately $104 million was 46% higher than the first quarter of 2021 with a higher revenue primarily driven by higher net realized sales prices for potash and Trio. We expect to be near the middle of our previous Trio guidance of 130,000 to 140,000 tons sold in the first half of 2022 and expect an average net realized sales price per ton of $480 to $490 in the second quarter. I guess, it seems like people are very focused on the price in the short-term versus the length that it could last with -- I mean, everyone's saying, global men, I guess, will be down this year, which was -- you're talking about less demand, less fertilizers, less yield higher crop prices that kind of lengthens it. I think that was in Q4 versus what actually got expensed or just can't get spread around as well that you would have taken the hit on now as you're actually selling this because I guess the charge you took was to get into like a reasonable level of price, but it's still -- I'm assuming elevated relative to getting on track for normal production and that's without the new injector system and anything."
