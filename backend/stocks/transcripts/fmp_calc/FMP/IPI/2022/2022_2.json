While our Trio gross margin totaled 13 million of roughly $10 million improvement over the second quarter of 2021.  strong EBITDA up performance, we've delivered 83 million in cash flow from operations to the first half of the year, which is allowing us to invest in our core mining assets to help drive more reliable and higher production, which in turn, reduces costs. Putting this all together for a forward outlook, while it's still too early to guide to more precise levels of demand and sales figures, we expect the strong financial performance to continue, which should drive continued high levels of cash generation and allow us to fund our capital program and other initiatives through cash from operations. As far as sales, like I said in my prepared remarks, we're not going to guide on second half just given where the market is today, but certainly expect pretty strong demand when sales pick up and then very positive outlook heading into fall and spring of next year."
