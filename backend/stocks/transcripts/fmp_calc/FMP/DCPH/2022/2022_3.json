    "content": " At ESMO, we also presented updated data from the Phase 1/2 study of vimseltinib, our orally administered inhibitor of CSF1 receptor for the treatment of patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor, or TGCT, not amenable to surgery. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I'll ask Matt to take your first question with respect to the Phase Ib part of the 3116 study and selection of dose and what we're expecting to see, what we would hope to see in the combination dose escalation part of the study and then I'd be happy to take the pan-RAF question that you tabled as well. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So while we haven't commented specifically on the exact number of sites that are open, certainly on clinicaltrials.gov, it's listed and there are 32 sites that are now open for the MOTION study, we're pleased with the number of patients that we've seen enrolling from those sites. Our commercial strategy in 2023 would continue to be focused on optimizing the opportunity within the fourth-line setting and continuing to execute  We have driving really high awareness, really high share of voice in the space, maintaining really high attribute rating for the product amongst just treaters, continuing to make sure that QINLOCK is viewed as a standard of care in the fourth line as it is today and making sure that we work to find every possible on-label patients that we can, and that will continue to be our focus as it relates to QINLOCK in the U.S.\n Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Barclays. Your line is open. Your line is open."
