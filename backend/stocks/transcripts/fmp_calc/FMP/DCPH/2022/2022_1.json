    "content": " The strong results in the first quarter speaks to the exceptional clinical benefit of QINLOCK in the fourth-line setting, the high unmet medical need and the hard work of the Deciphera team to bring GIST patients and physicians a new business option for the first and fourth line GIST. So first, before I turn it over to Matt on 3116, we're really excited about the data we've generated preclinically so far and now has been presented at a variety of different medical meetings, including most recently the KRAS G12C inhibitor data that we referenced at the AACR conference just a few weeks ago. And so we would expect for the data update in the second half to include, of course, longer-term follow-up on the patients who were enrolled in the dose escalation part of the study as well as follow-up on the now fully enrolled Cohort A previously untreated patient population in addition to disclosing for the first time data from Cohort B, the previously untreated patient population -- to the previously treated patient population."
