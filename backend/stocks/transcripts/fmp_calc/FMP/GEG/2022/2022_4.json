    "content": " For the fiscal fourth quarter, Investment Management reported total revenue of $1.5 million compared to $0.9 million during the same period in the prior year. For fiscal 2022, our Investment Management business generated $4.5 million in revenue compared to $3.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The variance primarily related to non-operating net realized and unrealized losses on the Company's managed investments, primarily GECC, of $7.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to net gains of $0.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2021. For fiscal 2022, adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.4 million as compared to positive $0.4 million in fiscal 2021, as higher payroll costs and consulting fees related to the Monomoy REIT's acquisition and other investments to fuel investment management growth outpaced the increase in revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2022, DME revenues were up 10.1% to $63.5 million compared to $57.7 million in the prior fiscal year. For the fiscal fourth quarter 2022, General Corporate reported a net loss of $2.8 million compared to a net loss of $8.3 million in the prior year quarter."
