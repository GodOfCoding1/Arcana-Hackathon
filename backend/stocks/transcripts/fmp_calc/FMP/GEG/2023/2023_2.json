    "content": " Assets under management of $619 million as of December 31, 2022 was relatively comparable with the prior quarter-end and up 2% year-to-date, while fee-paying AUM grew to $437 million, up over 2% quarter-to-date and over 7% year-to-date. We are well positioned to deploy capital into attractive alternative asset management investment in dislocated markets, thanks to our strong and liquid balance sheet, which holds approximately $90 million in cash on a pro forma basis for the Forest and DME transactions. As a result, on a pro forma basis for these transactions, Great Elm Group had approximately $90 million in cash on our balance sheet to deploy across our growing alternative asset management platforms."
