    "content": " This increase in our third quarter net sales was driven by our wholesale segment, where net sales for the quarter were $1.01 billion, up 29% compared to $783 million in last year's third quarter. Importantly, third quarter net sales for our wholesale segment are quickly approaching pre pandemic levels, down only 5% from third quarter net sales two years ago. We entered Turkey and Israel through wholesale distribution and will open two new partner operated stores for Donna Karan this quarter, one in Saudi Arabia, one in Riyadh, with a third to follow next year in Kuwait. Summing up the third quarter, based on the continued strength of our business, our flexibility to adjust as needed to capitalize on market share opportunities, an incredibly strong order book, we're raising our guidance for the full 2022 fiscal year. Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2021, increased approximately 23% to $1.02 billion from $827 million in the same period last year, and were above our guidance of $1 billion. Net income for the third quarter was $107 million or $2.16 per diluted share compared to $63 million or $1.29 per diluted share in last year's third quarter, and included direct losses from Wilsons and Bass store operations of $12 million, with $0.25 per share. Net income for the third quarter two years ago was $95 million or $1.97 per share, and included direct losses from Wilson's and Bass store operations of $4 million or $0.08 per share."
