    "content": " The sales opportunity of just our power brands DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld taken together have an annual net wholesale potential of $4 billion. Net sales for the first quarter ended April 30, 2021, increased approximately 28% to $520 million from $405 million in the same period last year, and above our guidance of $460 million. Net sales of our retail operations segment for the quarter were $19 million, approximately 43% lower than last year's sales of $34 million. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by the gross margin percentage in our wholesale operations segment, which was 36.3% compared to 29.6% in last year's quarter. For the full fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, we expect net sales of approximately $2.57 billion, which compares to $2.06 billion last year. For the second quarter ended July 31, 2021, we expect net sales of approximately $460 million, which compares to $297 million in the same period of the previous year. Your line is open. And as far as the SG&A, maybe it's a good time to give a little bit of a reminder what happened to us last year because that's really the baseline for what we're looking at this year. The biggest charge of that was in the first quarter of last year, and so we're certainly thinking that, that's behind us. Your line is open. Yes, Erinn, with respect to timing on Q1 and Q2, I think that what we're seeing is a very strong Q1, probably pulling a little bit from Q2, but still a very strong increases in this Q2 compared to last year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
