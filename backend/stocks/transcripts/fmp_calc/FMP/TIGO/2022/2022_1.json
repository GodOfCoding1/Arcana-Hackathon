    "content": " Panama as an investment great and all rise economy, Guatemala will grow GDP over 4% this year and the quetzal remains one of the world's strongest currencies, and Nicaragua remains one of our fastest-growing businesses as you saw this quarter on the back of strong and growing flow remedial. Colombia had a very solid quarter, with growth of 7.8%, with our mobile business up almost 17%, and that's coming mostly from the very strong postpaid net ads that Mauricio mentioned, which is driving ARPU up almost 4% in local currency. We want to use up momentum to bring it down with operating leverage into EBITDA growth and operating cash flow growth back ended this year because we believe we're completely on track to deliver that 10% operating cash flow growth on average for the next three years and, that's not back-ended total. It's really some seasonality, I think, in terms of our cash flows and working capitals move in the quarter and maybe a little bit CapEx spend being, as I said in my prepared remarks, a bit more equal across the years than maybe they have in years past where they were more back-end loaded or heavier weighted to Q4. If we shuffle the portfolio, moved to countries where we think we can have top-line growth, rate operating cash flow growth, and deliver because of our leverage, those operating cash flow targets of 10% on average on a yearly basis on $800 to $1 billion of equity free cash flow."
