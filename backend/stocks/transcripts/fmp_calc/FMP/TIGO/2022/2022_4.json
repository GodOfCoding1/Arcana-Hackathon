    "content": " So it won't be exactly a straight line to that $100 million exit, but that will be a big contributor for both years and Portella that 10% organic OCF growth over the 3-year -- all right. This is why where I would have wanted to give you Q4 numbers, but we would have been really persistent and everybody during the presentation to be like how doing talking about full year in Q4 because it's really in Q4 actually November, December, and you see the runout that MFS is high because you see the digital subscribers coming in, the merchants coming the revenue coming and significantly, the NPS really staying on very, very high in some really, really good results on our trials or through the entering. So I'll give you some color, and maybe Sheldon can bring it down to one just to some more specific in a time -- we've been investing, as we showed in the presentation, we usually see around EUR1 billion, just to give that lack number, obviously, we're coming in middle of that number with under names of an extremely healthy CapEx-to-sale ratio CapEx intensity over the last few years. I think the key one we mentioned were just the ones in the press release and mentioned earlier in the call, right, the operating cash flow of organic cash flow growth of 10% over the years 3 year. And as you don't point out, we gave a 3-year outlook that is composed of 3 key targets, 10% of credit cash flow both in average for that period to relative equity free cash flow or an $1 billion and reducing leverage to 2.5 by 2025 2x by long term."
