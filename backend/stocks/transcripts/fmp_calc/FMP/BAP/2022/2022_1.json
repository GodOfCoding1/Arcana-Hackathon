    "content": " BCP continues to register a strong profitability on a year-over-year basis -- the 18.6% growth in core income was fueled by net interest income, which was driven by a rising interest rate and a 14% uptick in structural loans measured in average daily balances. The interest income rise reflects an increase of 62 basis points in the average asset yield with minor changes in total volumes, which was the result of: a more profitable asset mix in which structural loans measured and average daily balances increased 12.4% while lower yield asset classes such as government program loans and liquid assets decreased. Mibanco's efficiency ratio improved 900 basis points, boosted by a hybrid model that has enabled it to increase operating income by 25.6% while keeping growth in expenses in check at just 10% year-over-year. What we are seeing is a very good pace of growth in microfinance and consumer segments in which we are also being able to have some pass-through of interest rate by the long-term operations in general are already challenged in mortgages, in long-term corporate and middle market clients, you already see a combination of the impacts of higher rates and political uncertainty in the deterrents further investments. So you announced a dividend last week of PEN 15 per share, which represents a payout of around 32% based on last year's earnings, which is below what you paid on 2018 and 2019 earnings prior to the pandemic, even though you are still above your internal minimum CET1 level of 11%, and the fact you are expected to accumulate capital going forward."
