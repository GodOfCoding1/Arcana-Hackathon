    "content": " We recorded EBITDA of $12.1 million and the second quarter earnings of $0.50 per share or $0.22 without the FEMA work, while our term loan was further reduced to $37.5 million during the period. We posted revenue of $108.7 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, versus $61.5 million in the prior year\u2019s fiscal second quarter. Income from operations was $10.3 million for the fiscal 2022 second quarter versus $4.6 million last year, again, reflecting the additional short-term FEMA contracts in Alaska. Interest expense was $0.6 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2022 versus $1 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower debt outstanding. Excluding the Alaska business, non-GAAP earnings for the fiscal 2022 second quarter were $3.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share. EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $12.1 million, versus $6.6 million in the prior year period due to the reasons I discussed earlier. Excluding $5.5 million related to our Alaska business, EBITDA for the fiscal \u201822 second quarter was $6.6 million, reflecting the planned investments in human capital and business development in the current quarter."
