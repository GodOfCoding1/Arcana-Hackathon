    "content": " Importantly, during the past year, DLH was selected as a competitor for future task orders across 7 domains of 3 multiple award IDIQ programs, $665 million ceiling with DA, one with $320 million ceiling with a National Institute of Health, and a large 10 year -- $10 billion ceiling under the program with the Department of Defense and its health agency. Turning to Slide 8, we posted revenue of 67.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 versus 65.2 million into prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fiscal fourth quarter. The 3% increase year-over-year reflects higher demand for services across many of our existing programs, excluding the 1.7 million derived from FEMA contracts in Q4 of fiscal 2021, revenue increased 6% year-over-year. Income from operations was 4.7 million for the quarter versus 4 million in the prior year period, and as a percent of revenue, the company reported an operating margin of 7% in fiscal 2022 versus 6.2 in fiscal 2021."
