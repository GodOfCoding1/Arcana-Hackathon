    "content": " Even excluding the $91.1 million of FEMA related work, we saw a revenue growth of 7% year-over-year as our programs remained strong and in strong demand despite an ongoing continuing resolution in Washington. Turning to Slide 6, we posted revenue of $152.8 million for the three months ended December 31st, 2021 versus $57.9 million in the prior year's first quarter. The growth reflects the impact of approximately $91.1 million in revenue tied to the Alaska FEMA contracts as Zach discussed, along with a 7% revenue increase across the other parts of our business. Turning to Slide 7, income from operations was $11.2 million for the fiscal 2022 first quarter, versus $3.6 million last year, again reflecting the additional short-term FEMA business. Interest expense was $0.7 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 versus $1.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower debt outstanding. DLH recorded a provision of $2.7 million and $0.7 million for tax expense during the first quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Excluding the Alaska business, non-GAAP earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2022 were $3.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share. But excluding $6.3 million related to our Alaska business, EBITDA for our ongoing contract portfolio was approximately $6.8 million or 11.1% as a percent of revenue in the fiscal 2022 first quarter. And so the deferred revenue and the use of cash for performance of deferred revenue really reflects the fact that right before the end of last fiscal year, we collected a very large advance payment from the state of Alaska for these FEMA contracts that we've talked about so much on this call."
