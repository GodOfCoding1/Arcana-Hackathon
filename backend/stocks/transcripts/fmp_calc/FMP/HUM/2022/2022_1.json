All other lines of business are performing as expected or slightly positive, further contributing to our strong quarter. Our efforts to drive increased mail order penetration are demonstrating success with 38% of our individual Medicare Advantage members utilizing our home delivery services in the first quarter, a 100 basis point increase year-over-year. As Bruce mentioned, Medicare Advantage members retained in 2022 used Humana Pharmacy\u2019s home delivery services, nearly 9% more frequently than members who disenrolled, also contributing to the strong start to the year. Within 5 years, we expect to support 50% of our Medicare Advantage membership with our value-based home health model and believe it will deliver mid-single-digit reductions in overall home health DME and infusion spend within 12 to 18 months of implementation and mid-double-digit reductions at maturity while improving patient outcomes. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so that is contemplated and will be contemplated in our earnings progression in 2023, where we would expect to, again, see a return to higher levels of Medicare growth while also delivering within our targeted long-term range of 11% to 15% off of that $24.50 baseline despite the hospice divestiture. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
