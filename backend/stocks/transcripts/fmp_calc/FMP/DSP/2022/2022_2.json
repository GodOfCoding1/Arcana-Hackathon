    "content": " As we continue to execute our long-term strategy of acquiring new customers and moving fixed price customers to our percentage of spend business model, this creates a near-term drag on our reported GAAP revenue growth rates relative to the growth rates we are seeing of total advertiser spend on the platform. Advertiser spend across our platform increased 32% over the prior year period and 15% over the prior quarter, despite a deceleration in spend that we saw in the last month of the quarter, as some of our customers adjusted their spending levels due to the challenging adverse macroeconomic environment. In terms of top line metrics for the second quarter, as I said, advertisers spend across our platform increased 32% over the prior year period and 15% over the prior quarter. Advertiser spend across all customer verticals, excluding automotive and CPG, increased 51% in Q2 versus the prior year period. Spend from our automotive and CPG customers, although down 13% on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, did show some improvement during the quarter, increasing 13% from Q1 levels and 3% from Q4 of last year. During the quarter, we also saw solid growth in advertiser spend across all key digital channels as customers are increasingly using the full omnichannel capabilities of our platform."
