    "content": " But just as a general rule, underwritten IRRs in our two core segments were in the 6% range or a bit higher a year ago, that's probably more like 7% a little bit higher today, so 400 basis points, plus or minus, obviously, depends on the asset, but just as a general rule. From where we sit today, we'd be less aggressive on development than we have been for the past five years when there was a pretty enormous spread between return on cost for development relative to acquisition cap rates as well as our cost of capital we've had in the last year, Austin, I think you realized cost of capital as adjusted, but return on cost is probably down in most industries, certainly in medical office and life science. They've been escalating in the 10% to 15% range per year for a little while now, but we're starting to see evidence as well as anecdotal feedback that, that's slowing down. So we saw close to 10%, we think that will moderate given the big -- the large growth in '22 that we're kind of assuming right now that's kind of a 3 plus, little bit higher than that ad rent growth for '23. So all the NOI growth that you see coming from that development and redevelopment portfolio, that's not benefiting same-store at all, but it's obviously generating a heck of a lot of NOI that will eventually flow through earnings absent some unique issues that we're overcoming this year. So when I said earlier, the unlevered IRR expectations for the highest quality product in our segments was probably started with the 6%, plus or minus 6% a year ago, that's probably more like plus or minus 7% today, and that seems to line up with the type of price that we got in Durham."
