    "content": " Same-store growth has consistently been at or near the top of the peer group, and we pointed three fundamental reasons: one, our on-campus locations, less than 30% of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventory is on campus, by contrast, 81% of our portfolio is on campus, plus another 6% that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjacent; two, the profitability of our host hospitals, which, on average, have profit margins 1,500 basis points above the national average; and three, operating experience and relationships that span more than two decades. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the rationale for doing the JV in life science, so when -- you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to back up to the opportunity set that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been describing for the last couple of years where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a $10-plus billion opportunity in land bank development and densification at the pacing that we would be completing that, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably a 10- to 15-year endeavor, which is an awful long time. So, as we look at the different opportunities, we will play through in life science and MOBs and believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get a great outcome from the unique way that those businesses have been put together and continue the development, and we do think the JVs allow us to accelerate and capture more income as we go forward with less drag, which makes for a smoother income growth model."
