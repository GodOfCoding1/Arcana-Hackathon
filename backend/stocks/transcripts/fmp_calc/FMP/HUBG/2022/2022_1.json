    "content": " Our logistics business is focused on bringing value-added services to our customers in high-growth areas, whether it's transportation management that brings technology to customers, allowing them to better control their supply chains, home delivery or LTL consolidation, all bring enhanced control with reduced costs for the customer. I think that's a bubble of freight that is going to impact back half demand actually in a positive way as hopefully that congestion eases and, once again, put us in a position where, I think, with the investments we're making in the fleet, the cross-selling that we're doing to get deeper with our customers, sets us on a good trajectory to hit what we've laid out in the press release and in our remarks. And I think something we haven't highlighted quite enough is probably the fact that 20% of our brokerage business is drop which gives us, we think, advantages to go out and win with the acquisition of Choptank on top of that in a variety of ways with our customers and we're seeing that take hold. And that's something we're going to our customers with to show, hey, we do think that there is a real run rate here for service improvement and an opportunity to convert more."
