    "content": " We are actively offsetting this decline in margin with an increase in in-source trade, up in year-over-year fourth quarter from 47% to 65%, improved rail agreements, lower outside drayage costs and several other operating cost improvements. Over the last five years, we have grown our top line by over 70%, both through organic growth in our asset-based Intermodal business as well as through acquisitions in our non-asset businesses that have brought us new capabilities in areas such as fulfillment, consolidation, final mile and refrigerated transportation, while also adding scale to our business. When I think about the 12% volume decline on the Intermodal side during the fourth quarter, that seems to be maybe a little bit worse than what we've heard from some peers and maybe some of the industry data that's out there. Yes, this is Phil. Yes, this is Phil. When we think about the guidance and the cadence, is there a quarter or a period in the year where a couple of negative things line up, be it the roll-off of accessorials and pricing or really anything like - or even the rail increase, where - you're just going to feel kind of the maximum part of the pain based on things you have some visibility into. Yes, I'd say at this point, it's probably pretty balanced with those two offsetting one another, maybe a little bit stronger in the first half, but we'll have more to say, obviously, as we get further into the year and what the rest of the year looks like."
