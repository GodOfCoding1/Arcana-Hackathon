I think if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen our growth, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been focused in the last several quarters and years, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really driven by our network model, which focuses on maximizing our margin per load day. And when you take into account higher fuel prices that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more exacerbated, you take in what Dave suggested in the front end that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tightening our transit and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing sequential improvement in rail service and all the investment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on there as well as smaller carriers exiting the market, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good backdrop in the medium term for demand for intermodal as well. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
