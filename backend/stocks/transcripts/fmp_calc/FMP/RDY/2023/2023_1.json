    "content": " In this quarter, we had a strong growth in our profit supported by the segment income and brand divestment while we were impacted by additional competition in key products in the U.S., caused inflationary pressure, normalization of   in Russia, and slowdown in the pharma market growth in India. Sales growth has been impacted due to higher base effect as Q1 FY 2022 included sales from COVID products and Q4 FY 2022 had higher sales in Russia, driven by stocking up, which is normalized in the current quarter."
