    "content": " Our Q3 2022 year-to-date top-line growth remains strong with total revenue of $791 million, a $339 million or 75% increase over the same period in the prior year, 99% of that revenue was derived from capitative agreement related to our at risk Medicare Advantage members. On a per-member, per-month basis, adjusted EBITDA loss year-to-date 2022 was $97 an improvement over a loss of $110 PMPM in the prior year, which reflects the power of our model to drive down costs. For the full-year 2022, we are reiterating the revenue guidance we gave on our second quarter call and expect revenue to range between 1.025 billion to 1.075 billion, representing a 61% to 69% increase over 2021. So in summary, our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $118 million to $128 million excludes approximately $12 million in profits move to 2021 and does not include an incremental 15 million to 20 million in revenue, which would be captured by the 2022 final sweeps and which are attributed to the 2020 due and prior years. As we think about our adjusted EBITDA guidance, if not for these adjustments, our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance loss would be an improvement of between $34 million and $42 million."
