    "content": " Free cash flow was $14.5 million for the quarter, up 71.6%. For the year, free cash flow was $58.9 million, up 63.3%. Now, excluding those expenses, operating margin would have been about 18%, which is in line with our target range and operating profit would have been about $2.5 million. The price of $66.5 million, consisting of $25 million in cash, $25.5 million in 10-year 7% seller financing, and 200,000 restricted shares of common stock valued upon closing at $80 per share. If you take that and say we're 10%of that, I think we could come up with -- say we do $100 million in -- I'm sorry, about 175 machines, yes. If we only do $10 million and we do 30% margin, we're still looking at $3 million in EBITDA a year, which puts us well within our hurdle range."
