    "content": " They\u2019re doing $6 million or $7 million, that\u2019s, call it, $75 million, $80 million, you say 22% margins when you give credit for the real estate, right, you\u2019re booking real estate through that, it\u2019s really more like 30% margins, because you\u2019ve got like, 7% of sales on real estate. I mean, the math I\u2019m doing is if we can get to 100 locations at some point at 7 million a box, right, which is that crazy if you think about Buffalo Wild Wings and whatnot that you talked about $700 million at a 30% operating margin, including real estate, that\u2019s $200 million\u2026\n I mean, if you look at your 6.5, you\u2019re close. I think we got hit for a couple of million in this quarter, I think we\u2019re going to get a hit in a couple of million, January, February, March, or just well, January, really is when we got hit about $2 million in December, about $2 million in January, call it 60% or 80% incremental margin. As I said, March, April, May is going to be huge for us, because then \u2013 and that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to be able to see, by May, we\u2019re going to know exactly what I think it\u2019s going to look like for the next 12 months, that\u2019s we\u2019re going to get a really good feel of, okay, hey, look we\u2019re at 80, now we\u2019re at 110. And the next thing I have 10,000 girls on there, I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a very, very powerful and significant try for us, plus it\u2019s going to increase our brick-and-mortar, I think frequency because a lot of guys are \u2013 we have a lot of really pretty girls that work for us and guys get intimidated. This year, they came down to $7 million and we couldn\u2019t turn down $7 million as \u2013 with an 8% cap rate and almost 11% return over the next 10 years on that property, we couldn\u2019t turn it down, we had to buy it."
