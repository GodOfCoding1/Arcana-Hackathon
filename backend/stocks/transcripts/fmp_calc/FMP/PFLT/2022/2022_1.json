    "content": " Overall for our platform from inception through December 31st, our $297 million of equity coinvestments have generated an IRR of 29% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.9 times. We're focused on the core middle market, which we generally define as companies with between $10 million and $50 million of EBITDA, the target market, where we think we add the most value and where we get the strongest package of risk return is in the $10 million to $30 million of EBITDA range. And for us, that's all very good because it leaves the core middle market, or even the lower middle market, a big opportunity for people like us, where our capital has meaning to the borrower, or we have 60 weeks to do proper due diligence, where we can really understand what we're buying, what we're more important to the borrower. And our target market today is kind of -- we start out with these companies that start out with between $10 million and $30 million of EBITDA, and they all have a game plan for growth, whether it be organic growth or inorganic growth. So, if you look at the history, floors are -- seem like they're permanent part of the landscape, although you do see some erosion when SOFR or LIBOR are far above what a typical floor would be, that's what we've seen, but it'll be interesting to see how things develop this time around."
