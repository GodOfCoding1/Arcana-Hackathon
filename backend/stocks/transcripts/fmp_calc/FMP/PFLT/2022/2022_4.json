    "content": " For the quarter ended September 30, our core net investment income was $0.30 per share which includes $0.01 of other income and excludes $0.01 per share of onetime upfront financing costs from the $66 million increase in our revolving credit facility. Overall for our platform from inception through September 30, our $355 million of equity co-investments have generated an IRR of 28% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.5x. For the quarter ended September 30, net investment income was $0.29 per share, including $0.01 per share of other income. Operating expenses for the quarter were as follows: management fees and performance-based incentive fees were $6.2 million, interest and credit facility expenses were $9 million, general and administrative expenses were $800,000 and provision for taxes were $100,000. For the quarter ended September 30, net realized and unrealized change on investments, including provision for taxes, was a loss of $19.6 million or $0.45 per share. But even if you took a severe case of kind of interest rates going up, by and large, our portfolio is well positioned to weather the storm, both from the standpoint of credit stats and capital structure, as well as just the industries we're in, by and large, tend to be more recession-resistant -- recession-resilient industries. And as we said, we have a nice opportunity in the secondary market where if we can buy $1 for between $0.85 and $0.95 in the secondary market in a company that we know well, perhaps we used to finance -- in one of our industry verticals, et cetera."
