    "content": " On the last quarter's call, we discussed the softening business environment expected for 2023 and the drivers for our revenue that should result in our continued outperformance versus WFE in the coming year. And while we steadily increased our share of lithography market over the past several years, it continues to represent less than 10% of our revenues, and therefore, the majority of our revenues will be impacted closer to the 25% to 30% range declines that are expected for non-litho WFE. Depending on the slope of the recovery, we could see a material improvement in customer demand towards year-end, and that would, therefore, be a fourth offset to the 25% range declines expected this year, which brings me to an update on our share gain initiatives.
