    "content": " Q3 revenues were a record $356 million at the upper end of our guidance range, and up 8% from the second quarter, similar to last quarter, we experienced continued improvement in components supply. And as such, the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance represents a 6% decline from our record third quarter Our above industry revenue growth expectation for 2022 is unchanged, however, at 20% year-over-year growth, assuming we come in around the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. So as we are nearing the end of a record revenue and earnings year, our focus turns to the expected spending environment over the next several quarters and our ability to flex our variable operating model to adjust to lower levels of WFE demand in 2023. As we look at our business today, however, there are a number a number of reasons why we believe our revenues will perform better than the expected 20% decline in overall WFE next year. Third quarter revenues were a record $356 million, up 8% from Q2 and 35% higher than Q3 of last year. And I'd say that, if you look at the margin improvement from last quarters, 70% to this quarters, 80%, probably around half of that was related to kind of this catch-up of cost recovery, with the remaining balance being some cost management and then just volume leverage inside the organization."
