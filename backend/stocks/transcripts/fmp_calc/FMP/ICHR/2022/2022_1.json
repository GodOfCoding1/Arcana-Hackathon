    "content": " Given the continued expectations for strong customer demand, and for wafer fab equipment growing to the $100 billion level, we made the decision to keep hiring to a level we needed to support the unconstrained demand, with the goal of having both the flexibility to burst within the quarter and to ramp the business as the availability of components and materials improves. Our Q2 operating expense forecast is approximately $23 million, consistent with prior expectations that our quarterly OpEx run rate would be moving up a bit with incremental investments in R&D, supporting our new product development programs for our new gas distribution products, some additional investment in IMG infrastructure costs, higher costs associated with our new ERP system and overall investments supporting company growth. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And so that is a decision that I made, because, as we have talked about hiring stuff, I think it is the right thing to do for the industry, our customers, in particular, to make sure that we can burst because supply constraints make it very difficult to be linear in your manufacturing, so you are going to have to burst to get as close as we did to the midpoint, for example, we burst it pretty heavily in the last month of the quarter. Please proceed with your question. I think if you look at, we are showing, if you take the midpoint 65-ish basis point improvement in margin, that is primarily driven by some volume leverage, as we get some more volume expectation up and also, we expect our machining business will do a little bit better than it did last quarter as we get through some of the supply chain issues that we had. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
