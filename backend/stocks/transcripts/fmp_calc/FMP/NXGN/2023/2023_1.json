    "content": " As for key revenue growth drivers this quarter, I call out our subscription services revenue line grew a healthy 12% and reflects double-digit growth in NextGen Office, and cross-selling of our surround solutions into our enterprise base. Adding to David's comments, we continue to see increased demands across our client base for surround solutions like managed services and EDI and new client wins accounted for over 25% of bookings this quarter, a continuation of a trend that we've seen for approximately 2 years. Transactional and data services, which includes patient pay, generated $27.2 million in revenue this fiscal quarter, down 2% over the year ago period due to modest decline in data revenue, which can be lumpy. This trend reflects a combination of factors, which we discussed last quarter, including our investments in centers of excellence and other activities to accelerate spring '21 migration and a products mix shift, particularly given the decline in nonrecurring software license revenue and the low increase in lower-margin managed services. And so we expect to see that strategy of helping clients be sure they achieve their financial outcomes, will continue to drive growth for us because they're competing against the market that has dramatically increased kind of at the lower end when you think about $15 to -- read about $15 to $17 an hour is the new normal."
