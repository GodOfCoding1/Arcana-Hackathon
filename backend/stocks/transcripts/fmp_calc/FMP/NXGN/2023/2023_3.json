    "content": " So, we can see the growth that we're looking for from that next year, but yes, it's mainly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you'll see a rebound next year as Jaime said in his comments \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or next quarter, I mean, in the recognizable license revenue, and we'll be, as we talked about on the full-year number as we projected in the guidance. We'll give guidance in our call in May, but we're spending money this year to still hit our EPS guidance range, but we're using that money to improve our cyber profile to improve our productivity to do more robotic process automation and some of these things that will have a good NPV for us and present value for years to take care of these things one-time. So, it gives you confidence that this quarter looks good, but I do think like I said in an earlier answer, I think next year we're going to move the license revenue down from our own budgetary expectations because of the lumpiness."
