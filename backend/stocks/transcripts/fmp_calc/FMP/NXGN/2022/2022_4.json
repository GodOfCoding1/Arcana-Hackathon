    "content": " We highlighted NextGen's top goals, including our path to accelerating revenue growth and our target 10% rate by fiscal \u201825  longer-term operating leverage and expanding adjusted EBITDA figure and the Rule of 40 performance metric, which combines revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin. Software subscription services generated $42.1 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, an increase of 10% year-over-year. EDI and data generated $26.4 million in revenue this fiscal fourth quarter, up almost 3% over the year ago period as transaction volumes remain strong. Within our office domain we continue to see consistent growth in the core, which is offered as a multi-tenant SaaS, RCM upsell and other managed services, which includes chronic condition management, and insights we believe various initiatives around connectivity discussed at our recent Investor event are expected to start to impact our results in the second half of fiscal \u201923. We are factoring in our earlier comments on mid-single digit revenue growth in the first half fiscal \u201923, combined with slight compression of gross margin, increased R&D spend in the fiscal first quarter, we arrive at non-GAAP EPS ranges for the first fiscal quarter in the mid-teens."
