    "content": " While NextGen is already delivering accelerating revenue growth having generated 2% growth in fiscal 2020, 3% growth in fiscal 2021 and now approaching mid-single digits in fiscal 2022, but I'm challenging the team to achieve even higher levels, and at the same time, to keep an eye on the bottom line. NextGen generated total revenue of $149.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Our largest revenue category, software subscription services generated $41.2 million in the fiscal third quarter or 8% growth year-over-year. EDI and data generated $26.2 million in revenue this fiscal third quarter, up 5% over the year ago period, as transaction volumes remain strong. And one more following up from me on the \u2013 maybe the bookings and really just trying to understand the balance between the solid bookings number, the really strong trends in bookings coming from new clients and the deal size seems to be reflecting clients adopting more of your profile against what I think might be the biggest software license quarter in two and a half years, which I would think would come more from a existing client."
