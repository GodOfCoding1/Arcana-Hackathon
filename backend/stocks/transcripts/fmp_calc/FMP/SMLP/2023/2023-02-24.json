    "content": " Earlier this morning, we announced full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $290 million to $320 million, which at the mid-point represents again over 40% year-over-year growth on an absolute basis and approximately 15% growth after you normalize for the 2022 acquisitions and divestitures. For our 2023 capital guidance ranges from $45 million to $65 million this year, including maintenance and that also reflects $10 million to $15 million of onetime expenditures to kind of fully integrate and optimize the Hereford, Outrigger and Sterling systems in the DJ. Summit reported a fourth quarter net loss of $23.9 million, adjusted EBITDA of $50.3 million, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $212.3 million above the midpoint of our original guidance range and free cash flow of over $70 million for the year. We want to provide some clarity, as we know a lot of our investors look at run rate EBITDA, so at $50 million of as reported, plus $4 million of weather and unusual expenses, plus another $8 million for a full quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contribution of DJ Acquisitions that would suggest a run rate EBITDA closer to $62 million for the fourth quarter, providing a little bit more context for everyone as we look forward into 2023. In the Northeast, which is inclusive of our SMU system, our proportionate share of Ohio Gathering joint venture and our Marcellus system, the segment averaged 1.35 Bcf per day during the quarter, which is inclusive of 754 million a day of 8/8ths OGC volumes, and segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $19.1 million, a slight decrease of $0.3 million from the third quarter of 2022. The Rockies segment, which is inclusive of our DJ and Williston Basin systems generated adjusted EBITDA of $13.8 million, which was down by $0.4 million relative to the third quarter largely due to a winter storm in December that caused several days of outages and interruptions in North Dakota and Colorado. Under the Permian Basin segment, which includes our 70% interest in the Double E Pipeline reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million, was down $0.7 million relative to the third quarter, primarily due to lower volumes on Double E. We believe that the low natural gas prices in Waha were the primary driver for customers diverting some of their volumes off of a Double E to other higher priced end markets during the quarter. The Piceance segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $14.7 million, up $0.4 million relative to third quarter due primarily to lower operating expenses during the quarter, partially offset by natural production declines and no new wells connected to the system. The Barnett segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million, a decrease of $0.6 million relative to third quarter, primarily due to lower natural gas sales and an increase in direct operating expenses."
