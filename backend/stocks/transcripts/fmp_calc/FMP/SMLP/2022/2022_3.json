    "content": "  Summit reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million, representing an 8% quarter-over-quarter growth which keeps us on track to achieving maybe even slightly exceeding the high end of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $205 million to $220 million. Given our strong momentum in the back half of 2022, and the expected addition of at least 275 wells in 2023, pro forma for the DJ Basin acquisitions, we would expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to exceed $300 million, which would result in more than $125 million in free cash flow and a meaningful reduction in leverage to approximately 4.25x at year-end 2023. The segment averaged 1,420 million cubic feet per day during the quarter, inclusive of 783 million cubic feet a day of 8/8ths OGC volumes and segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $19.4 million, which increased $0.8 million from the second quarter of '22. The Permian Basin segment, which includes our 70% interest in the Double E Pipeline reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.9 million, which was relatively flat till the second quarter due to flat volumes on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The Barnett segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $7.9 million, an increase of $0.6 million relative to the second quarter primarily due to a 2% increase in volume throughput and a $200,000 increase in natural gas sales."
