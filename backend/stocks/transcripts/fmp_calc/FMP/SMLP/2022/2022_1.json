    "content": " There were also three new wet gas wells that came online late last year behind our OGC joint venture that also produced over a 100 million a day during the quarter, while we haven't heard of producers increasing activity levels in the Utica during 2022 at this point, we remain very excited about the natural gas price fundamentals, productivity of the wells in the region, and prospects for potential upstream M&A that could represent a significant catalyst behind our systems. Volumes average 312 million a day, a decrease of the approximately 1.6% relative to fourth quarter, and this was primarily due to natural production declines, partially offset by volume from the new nine well pad that was turned online in October of 2021. The Barnett segment, reported adjusted EBITDA 9.3 million, a decreases 0.9 million relative to fourth quarter, primarily due to natural production declines from the seven new wells that were brought online in late September, 2021."
