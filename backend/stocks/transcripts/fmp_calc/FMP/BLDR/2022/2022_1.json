    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 120% to $1 billion driven by strong demand across our key customer end markets, higher commodity prices and improved gross margins. What we're anticipating is that the back half of this year, we'll see some normalization, that we'll see a directional trend in commodity prices back towards our long-term estimate around the base business, $400. Timing is a great question, and we've tried to incorporate that the back half in a reasonable way as our trend is down sort of analytics, but -- that's really what we're trying to account for in this forecast for the remainder of the year. But maybe it would help if you could kind of -- I think, historically, I would think about rising commodity periods like we just had in the first part of the year as a detractor to gross margin, and yet you guys still posted well over 30% gross margin, which is way above, I think, your normalized range."
