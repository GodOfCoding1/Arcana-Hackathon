Your line is now open. Hey, good morning everyone. There's a lot going on in the market and so we've stayed away from the cash flow including it in the full year scenarios, but yes, the short answer to your question is we still think it's north of $1 billion in free cash flow, assuming about a 20% starts down scenario and a reasonably steady commodity environment. Your line is open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is open. Your line is now open. Hey, good morning everyone. Your line is open. Your line is now open. So I had some technical difficulties, so I'm just going to ask one question, so I don't repeat anything and hopefully this one's not repetitive, but the reiteration of the $7 billion to $10 billion in deployable capital from the Investor Day, I think starts are probably likely off in the 30% range and I kind of looked at that deployable capital as kind of a free cash flow equivalent. Your line is open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
