    "content": " During the second quarter, we continued to implement our strategic portfolio shift with the focus on residential real estate related investments as we acquired $293 million of residential holders in anticipation of executing our fourth whole loan securitization, which was completed in early July. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter, selling approximately $42 million of investments, including non-agency RMB, and CMBS as well as repurchasing another 7.2 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 2022 notes at an approximate premium to par value of 1%. We also benefited from lower operating expenses in the quarter, when excluding the costs associated with completing the residential whole loan securitization in the first quarter, our focus on discipline expense management resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of $303,000."
