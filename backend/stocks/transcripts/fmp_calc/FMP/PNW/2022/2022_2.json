    "content": " This application will really focus on a return to balanced ratemaking, which will enable the company to make the necessary investments to support Arizona's growing economy, resilient infrastructure, service reliability, improved customer experience and a clean and secure energy future for our customers. Finally, I'd like to congratulate Ted Geisler on his recent promotion to President of APS, returning to a separate CEO and President roles within APS allows us to consolidate our core utility functions, including operations, public policy, technology, customer experience and strategy, and Ted's well-rounded utility experience will be extremely valuable in this role. Additionally and very importantly, in the near-term, benefit cost is also impacted by this asset allocation to fixed income and higher prevailing fixed income yields would be reflected in next year's expected return on plan assets. But in 2023 will be an offset that, I think may be missing from some of the calculations out there because we were starting from an expected return on assets this year that's lower than most of the industry at around 5% because we're so heavily invested in fixed income. Second, Jeff I guess as you're going through the stakeholder process and getting ready for the late fall rate case filing and with the IRA Bill that -- who knows what will happen, but if it -- that could potentially benefit, I guess and make it more favorable to just the outlook for further investments in solar and other clean energy resources. It does help with volatility from a benefit cost perspective and that's because of the way we mark our fixed income assets to market at the end of the year, which in a rising interest rate environment helps with our expected return in the following year."
