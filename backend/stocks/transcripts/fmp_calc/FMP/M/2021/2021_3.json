    "content": " Our digital business is on track to generate $10 billion in sales by 2023, and that figure does not include the incremental revenue we expect this new marketplace platform to generate for Macy's, Inc. Now I will provide you some highlights from the third quarter. Looking at each of our nameplates, comparable sales for Macy's brand were up 8.4% on an owned-plus-licensed basis, which represents a nearly 1-point improvement versus last quarter, when we take into consideration the friends and family marketing shift. Moreover, while digital sales continued to grow and store sales trends continued to improve, notably more than 70% of our omnichannel market saw overall sales growth over and above 2019 levels, which represented approximately 85% of Macy's brand, comparable owned plus licensed sales."
