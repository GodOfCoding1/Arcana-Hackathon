Our rate of 38.6% in the first quarter was certainly above Q1 2020, but even when we compare against first quarter 2019 and despite higher penetration of digital sales, gross margins were up 40 basis points. When you look at the Macy's Media Network, I think that's just a case point of how we're working with our vendors, and really using just the power of our Web site to expand their brands to new customers in mutually beneficial ways. We are testing as a third priority the potential productivity and profitability of the smaller format that Jeff mentioned that we're focused on in Dallas as well as in the Atlanta markets, and really trying to understand the level of productivity, the level of profitability, and how it allows us to gain market share in a market as we think about the full breadth of our assets from off-price to luxury and our off-mall as well as on-mall assets."
