    "content": " Loyalty program members are important to our omnichannel business, comprising approximately 65% of our total Macy's brand, comparable owned plus licensed sales for the first half of 2021, and our omnichannel customers shop with us more often, make 3 times as many trips as single-channel customers, purchase across 2 to 3 times more product categories and spend 2.5 to 3.5 times more. We also recognize that increasing digital penetration with our business is really a leveraged sales -- leveraged point for an SG&A, and we're constantly looking at ways for our sales teams in our stores or selling team in our stores to find ways to be even much more productive while maintaining that our stores are at brand standard."
