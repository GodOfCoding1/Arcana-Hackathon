    "content": " Macy's sales were also affected by an accelerated category shift, away from the popular pandemic categories, such as casual and activewear as well as Soft Home, and into more occasion-based apparel, like dresses, women's shoes, men's clothing and furnishings. Hey, Chuck, on the -- let's talk first about the -- when we talk about the customers and who were affected by whatever might be happening in the macro environment, I think what we -- one of the headlines is that, we saw the customer count and the customer spend across all of our kind of income buckets go up in the quarter. I think the -- when you think about just kind of aggregate comment about category, what we saw about the spend levels were definitely a downshift in the casual, active and soft home categories from the trends that we saw in 2021 and definite upshift in the categories versus fourth quarter and first quarter, when you look at the dress-up categories, special occasion, travel categories. And we're also seeing that we are fulfilling more orders from stores up about 3.5 points versus the first quarter of last year, which is a good thing in terms of the distance that packages have to travel to get to the customer. Conversely, to the other part of your question, on big acceleration and dress-up categories, and those have gone up 10 full points when you look at where the trend was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and that's getting even better in the second quarter. We do expect that, that the vendor and the campaign count is going to continue to grow as the company -- as Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as we expand our vendor base, and as well as with the upcoming launch of the Macy\u2019s marketplace, which is going to be in the third quarter So we're quite bullish on this."
