    "content": " Despite significant market uncertainty in the quarter, our core Wealth and Asset Management businesses delivered strong profitable growth representing nearly 80% of Ameriprise's earnings in the quarter. Client assets grew 8% to $823 billion and our advisor force, continue to deliver exceptional productivity growth with revenue per advisor reaching $810,000 in the quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Adjusted operating net revenues grew 9% to $2 billion from robust client flows, which were supplemented by year-over-year market growth. Based upon the market's expectation of 350 basis point increase, followed by 225 basis point increases in the balance of the year, we would expect an additional benefit to pretax earnings exceeding $200 million in 2022. Overall, Wealth Management profitability remained strong with pre-tax adjusted operating earnings of $440 million, up 13% from last year. Adjusted operating revenues increased 23% to $1 billion, reflecting the cumulative benefit of net inflows and business growth, strong performance fees and market appreciation. I think what I would say, if I even look at over the course of the year or from the first quarter, et cetera, we're up a few billion dollars as we sort of - usually what you have is a little more of a draw down in the first quarter as more money goes back into work from the end of the year and stuff."
