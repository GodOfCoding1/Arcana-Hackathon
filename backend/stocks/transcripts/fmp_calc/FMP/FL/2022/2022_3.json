    "content": " In summary, in addition to continuing down the path of offering an exciting range of brand options for our customers, giving incremental focus to our omnichannel capabilities and loyalty programs, continuing the cost optimization work that's underway and further simplifying our business, I see a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead for Foot Locker, Inc., and I look forward to updating you on our new strategies as we move forward. With our non-Nike sales in core banners up mid-single digits in the third quarter and nearly 10% year-to-date, our efforts in elevating and driving growth in other brands has progressed more quickly than we expected at the beginning of the year. I think at the start of the year, you said that Nike would fall below 55% of total sales by the end -- I guess, by the fourth quarter and you're kind of coming in better than that. And I think as we think about certainly the momentum we're already seeing with the diversification of brands, and I think Frank said it well, we're seeing things with new brands, bringing new customers, women getting more attracted to Foot Locker, and we're really just getting started."
