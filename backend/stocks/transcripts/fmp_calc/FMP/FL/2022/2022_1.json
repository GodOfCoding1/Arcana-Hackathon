    "content": " With our overall comps down 1.9%, the majority of our top 20 vendors posted sales gains in the quarter to strength from some of our biggest brands like Adidas and Puma and even more outsized growth from brands like New Balance, Crocs and Congress, all of which were up over 50%. Our efforts to grow our apparel and accessories business continue to yield results with the category's well outpacing footwear once again, comping up over 10% despite difficult year-over-year comparisons. And overall performance continues to run ahead of our original forecast, putting us well on track to achieve $1 billion of top line sales by 2024 or a 20% CAGR from an expected $650 million top line this year."
