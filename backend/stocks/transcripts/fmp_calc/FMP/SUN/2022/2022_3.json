    "content": " Moving on to Q3 results, the partnership recorded net income of $83 million and adjusted EBITDA of $276 million, compared to $104 million and $198 million, respectively in the third quarter of 2021. As a result of the strong performance year-to-date, and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $845 million to $865 million, excluding the recently announced Peerless Oil & Chemicals acquisition. If we step back and think about the third quarter, even considering the acceleration of margin from the fourth quarter, we delivered over $250 million of EBITDA. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were seeing trends as you compare to last year or even back to 2020 or '21 on better performance in the third quarter than what we talked about in the second quarter, and that's continued into the fourth quarter."
