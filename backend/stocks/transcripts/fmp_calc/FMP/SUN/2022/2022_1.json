    "content": " First quarter's strong results, the recently closed acquisitions and the successful extension of our revolving credit facility, demonstrate our commitment to maintaining Sunoco's solid financial foundation and to increase value to our stakeholders through a strategy of disciplined capital investment and balance sheet management. The first is the 7-Eleven makeup payment that occurs annually in the first quarter; second, industry breakeven margins continue to stay elevated, especially in the face of rising inflation; finally, our gross profit optimization strategy continues to be part of our day-to-day business which particularly helps us in volatile market conditions. So I wouldn't say we're quite back to where the pipeline was in the first -- if you remember, that pipeline started up at the end of 2019 and it was just ramping up in the first quarter and kind of in full operation in the first quarter of 2020. And then the other thing, with today's prices, one of the things that E15 -- that makes it interesting is that even when you adjust for the lower BTU content, it's still a cheaper fuel which in today's market is -- makes it more attractive but we still haven't seen a huge demand pickup for that."
