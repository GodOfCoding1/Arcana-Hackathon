    "content": " Stable base business, combined with the contributions from acquisitions and organic growth will continue to generate free cash flow and allow us to focus on the 3 pillars of our capital allocation strategy: first, to maintain a secure distribution for our unitholders; second, to protect our balance sheet; and third, to continue to pursue disciplined investment and growth opportunities. But from a volume and margin going into gross profit, we're very comfortable with what our business has yielded and I think the last 3 years has shown that because we've seen various situations during those 3 years."
