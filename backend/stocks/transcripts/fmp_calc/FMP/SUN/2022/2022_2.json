    "content": " First, to maintain a stable and secure distribution for our unitholders; second, to protect our balance sheet through debt paydown when prudent; and third, to pursue disciplined investment in our growth opportunities like the recent acquisitions we've announced in the past few quarters. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've made some investments in our people, and I think some of that is us starting even back -- going back into last year, making any changes whether it's in wages or targeting certain areas and beefing up our staffing to make sure that we dealt with that."
