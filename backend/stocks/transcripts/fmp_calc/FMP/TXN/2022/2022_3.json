Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I would not be uncomfortable, as I said before, adding another $1 billion, $1.5 billion of inventory over the next several quarters to get us well positioned for the next upturn that invariably comes at some point. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
