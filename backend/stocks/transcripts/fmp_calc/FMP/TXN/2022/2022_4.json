    "content": " I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. We encourage you to review the \"Notice regarding forward-looking statements\" contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. First, you likely saw last week we announced that Haviv Ilan will become President and CEO on April 1st and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. Secondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2nd, at 10:00 a.m. Central time, we will have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for first quarter of 2023. Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. In first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline, with the exception of automotive, as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels. Turning to our segments, fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down about 10%. Next, communications equipment was down about 20%, and finally, enterprise systems was down about 20%. Lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. The six end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%, automotive about 25%, personal electronics 20%, communications equipment 7%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. In 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about three percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Operating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, or 17% of revenue. As production started at the beginning of December, these costs then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward. In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets. Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 47% of revenue. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion, or $2.13 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases. Inventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially. Next, to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in third quarter. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. In 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion, or 30% of revenue. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. I guess, the first question is, if you could just maybe characterize what you're seeing going to Q1, you're talking about that being worse than seasonal. Yes, Chris, thanks for that question. I'd say that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into first, meaning that we expect our end markets to decline with the exception of automotive. And we do believe, as you just said, that the customers are continuing to work to get their inventories lower. Let me take that, and we're going to go through all of that, both the CapEx, depreciation and ITC and the CHIPS Act in great detail next week. For now, what I would tell you is, as you said, RFAB2 is in production, Lehi is in production. So as both of those ramps, the equipment goes in service starts depreciating. But big picture, what we told you last year on depreciation was that it would ramp roughly linearly to about $2.5 billion in 2025. And again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you an update on that next week, but I do want to say just as I said 90 days ago, that since we talked about this last year, our confidence surrounding our long-term growth prospects have only grown. And if you alluded to, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the CHIPS Act also since last year that, that legislation pass in August. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 next week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all the puts and takes between those trends and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll paint a clearer picture at that point. And maybe just add a small piece that linear ramp will go from about $1 billion a depreciation that we had this year at about $0.5 billion a year till we get to $2.5 billion, so just kind of doing the math for you. So thanks, Chris, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the next caller, please. Next, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hear from Chris Danely of Citi. Hey guys, so Dave, I believe you said that your confidence in the long-term growth rate has only increased. I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thanks for the question, Chris. So just as that structurally grows faster than the rest of the market, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re convinced more than ever that that will continue to drive our top line and also the products that we have inside of those markets. So since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared publicly our plans last February in capital management call, I just say that, that the response has been very, very strong. And first, big picture let me point you to our scorecard. The one that we used for capital management when we talked about the objectives in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when it comes to inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keeping stable lead times while minimizing inventory obsolescence, our strategy and our portfolios such that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-lived a very diverse, our customer base. And the timing, that all depends on revenue trends. So if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re higher, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take longer. If those serving trends are a little weaker, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a little faster to get there. On the mix is a number of angles on that, chip stock versus finished goods, we have a mix of both of those. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the next caller, please. Dave, hoping you guys could talk a little bit about trends in China, what you saw in Q4, if there was any choppiness toward the end of the quarter, and more importantly, how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about Q1 and beyond. I guess, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope out there that China as an economy bounces back in 2023. Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, some of the disruptions that we saw earlier in the year, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any of that here in the fourth quarter. And certainly, as that economy comes back and consumption increases in China, obviously helping the world GDP, but that would obviously help us as well. But it feels like you may have underperformed in the quarter, and I realize it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one quarter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take that question and Rafael, if you want like to add. And I think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way the markets behave and even looking at one year or even longer, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to look at three and five and 10 years of performance especially when you go through choppy times like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through in the last 18 months or so. And so pricing just to comment on that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing unusual going on with pricing. As you know, pricing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move quickly in our markets, our practices and pricing though I know that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed with many of our peers, our practices have not changed. We just continue to price aggressively in the marketplace, but pricing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the reason why customers choose our product. So thank you for those questions, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the next caller. In the last earnings call, the team talked about seeing increasing cancellations. Harlan, so the first question is, in a weakening environment, not too surprising. And from a consignment versus classic backlog, customers really not much difference there. Their visibility \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get visibility out six months, their visibility to their demand can change, as we know very rapidly within the 90 days or certainly even within 30 days as those windows move a long time. And oftentimes if customers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t canceling orders, what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is rescheduling them back out in time. So embedded drove 10% year-over-year growth in the second half of last year, it also drove slight sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Yes, first I would just say that our efforts having impact, they are. So, we continue to work on that business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to do that. When we think about the market opportunity for embedded and analog, we think that both of those markets have about the same growth opportunities. So in time the growth rates will converge, though they could be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you could see differences in any given quarter. But longer term, we believe that they can grow at the same rates. And Harlan will go to the next caller, please. Dave, I had a question about just the analog business generally, both with respect to share and margins. And then on share, just in that same point, the share, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of the calendar fourth quarter looks like, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty clear that the share is going to be down about 150 basis points this year, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of back to 2012 levels. Yes, let me address first on your margin question. And when it comes to gross profit, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the results you came in about as expected. And it decrease, as we said in the prepared remarks, it decreased primarily due to lower revenue, the transition of LFAB-related cost to a cost of revenue, as well as the cost related to increased investments over the last several quarters that are now flowing through the P&L. And those are long-term investments that are going to position us very well for top-line growth for many, many years to come. And on this, the second part of the question, I think Dave already answered, you go to look at this over a long time, not any one quarter and particularly during choppy times. Yes, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just add that I think our approach to building closer relationships with customers has served us well. As you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve moved and taken more of our revenue direct as well as providing services through ti.com. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provided a lot of advantages including, as being better able to see and respond to changes in demand. And you know as customers are reducing their inventories now, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t employed any long-term sales agreements or non-cancelable, non-reschedulable contracts, really just focused on customers, and trying to meet their needs and service them well for the long-term. And as we talked about, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you some insight into that next week, and how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to change some of our plan. So year-on-year, automotive was up about 30%. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the next caller, please. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just looking at the auto business and the rest of the business everything is decelerating as you would expect, and auto seems to be, if not accelerating, kind of in that high-20%s, 30% range. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just love to get some perspective from you guys on the disparity between autos and the rest of the broader businesses. And if you remember, as the pandemic spread in third quarter, we saw wide and very deep cancellations across all of the markets including automotive. The other markets began to follow, but automotive was the last to respond. And people early in the pandemic weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shopping for cars, they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going out of the house. And as manufacturers tried to reopen, they had more issues with COVID protocols and working to bring their plans back online. It may not, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lots of reasons why besides us gaining share, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more content, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mix and other factors inside of that. So the CHIPS Act has both an ITC, investment tax credit and grants. But right now, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any information to share on that. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all the accruals that we have taken so far, the 400 million that we have taken are all for the ITC, for the investment tax credit, 25% investment credit for U.S.-based manufacturing. In fact, let me take a second and kind of walk through how it flows through the financial. You can see the increase year-on-year, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 400 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what a 400 million receivable is for that ITC. If we had not taken the ITC, that $400 million would have gone to property, plant and equipment. So you can see property, plant and equipment $6.9 billion that would have been $7.3 billion. So instead on a long-term asset, a receivable therefore it's not going to depreciate that $400 million doesn't appreciate because it's not part of PP&E, and eventually, we'll get the cash. Now to your question right now, based on our interpretation of the law, we're not going to get that cash until late 2024. You get a kind of one-year late, but that could change. Clearly, that's something that companies are advocating forward to get that cash early. But right now, we're not planning to get that until 2024. So again, that's how you see it on the balance sheet, lower PP&E. And then eventually, we return it to the owners of the company or use it for other \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the corporate core business. So yes, so not to add more confusion, but we get the cash through filing the taxes. However, this will not affect the tax rate because the accounting will put that, as I just described, through lower PP&E and you actually see the cash in the cash flow statement in the investing section. But the actual receiving of the cash happens at tax filing time in October or so of September of every year, and we just paid less taxes to that. But again, not to confuse you, the tax rate will not change. Operator, we have time for one more caller, please. You're more direct than many of your peers that you have a better, I guess, view into end demand theoretically. Joshua, maybe just quickly, obviously, when customers begin reducing inventory, its number one quarter phenomenon. We won't have a sight and it obviously will also depend on what happens to their end demand, which we can't predict. You know, a lot of attention gets paid to your CapEx for obvious reasons, but R&D grew I think 7% or 8% in 2022 after being flat for a few years. So first, these are long-term investments in nature. The R&D, clearly that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we get the, continue to build on the broad portfolio. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we have process technology and that we get results over many, many years into the future. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just R&D, even in SG&A we have areas that are tied to capabilities. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another place where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tied to a long-term top line growth of the company to be strengthening the reach of channels advantage, you could add CapEx to that picture. If you look at the, over the last four or five years, our OpEx, so R&D and SG&A, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been at a very steady $3.2 billion for like four or five years. This year for the first time, we picked that up to $3.4 billion. And actually that was an impact on due to inflation, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not immune to that, you can expect that to continue increasing a little bit over the, in 2023 and over the next several years as we continue to increase investments. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the inflation component and but big picture, those are great long-term investments that will feel the growth for the company over the next 10 to 15 years. Again, we look forward to sharing with you our capital management update next Thursday, February 2nd, at 10:00 AM Central Time."
