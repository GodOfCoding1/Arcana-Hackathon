    "content": " Excluding foreign exchange impacts, adjusted operating income was up 43% in the quarter. Asia Pacific operating income was $27 million, up $6 million versus prior year, with favorable price mix that more than offset higher input costs and foreign exchange impacts. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, adjusted operating income was up 43% in the quarter. EMEA operating income was $30 million for the quarter, up $7 million compared to prior year due to resilient performance in Europe, which was partially offset by higher corn costs and supply chain challenges in Pakistan as well as foreign exchange headwinds. For EMEA, we expect net sales to be up 10% to 15%, which includes KaTech and we now expect operating income to be flat to up low single digits, driven by favorable price mix, partially offset by higher corn and energy costs and negative foreign exchange impacts."
