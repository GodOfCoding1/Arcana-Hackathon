    "content": " Combined with a better product mix, our second quarter adjusted operating income grew 3% over last year's very strong second quarter. Excluding $5 million of foreign exchange impacts, EMEA's adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter. We continue to expect operating income to be flat to prior year driven by higher corn costs in Korea related to the Ukraine conflict and the impact of COVID lockdowns in China, offsetting stronger growth from PureCircle. For EMEA, we expect net sales to be up 10% to 15%, and we expect operating income to be flat to down low single digits, driven by higher corn and energy costs and negative foreign exchange impacts. That plant is ramping up -- and so we have phased our outlook with a brighter outlook for the second half in comparison to what we've endured in the first half and specifically quarter 2 was the low watermark, we think, for the year, and it's just getting -- going to just get it better and improve in the second half."
