    "content": " So what we're seeing in the environment is the only, despite all the macro headlines and stock market going down earlier this year, the only places where we've seen some weakness is what I would call kind of the medium sized tech companies, who maybe they hope to go public, haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone public yet or maybe they were hoping for that next round of financing and they had a mentality previously of growth at any cost. If they \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they feel like if they take their foot off the accelerator for one minute, the competitors will grab the talent and they'll be at a disadvantage, and there's still a talent shortage mentality amongst those big companies, and as long as we stay close to them and we're doing everything in our power to help them with everything related to talent, if not just hiring people, but it's also advising, consulting on a whole lot of different things, whether technology tools, diversity hiring initiatives, we are in good shape."
