    "content": " SG&A costs were $21.2 million in the third quarter, up 49% versus the same period last year in constant currency. The third quarter's results were impacted by less favorable foreign exchange rates, a reduction in project RPO work and a slowdown in hiring activity in the technology sector, which is expected to continue into next year. And then we have about 10% of our business that is focused on the technology sector, which is a little bit different business model that's more recruit-on-demand, shorter-term contracts, and that a lot of that work that we do is for medium-sized tech companies, and in some cases, pre-IPO, and that business has declined very significantly from the peak earlier this year and unclear when that rebounds. Each year is different, each quarter is different, but there's many things that will be better for us in Q4 versus Q3, except the tech sector, which we think is going to be worse in Q4 than Q3, just many, many companies in the technology sector are putting on a hiring freeze, laying off people. And for the first time, I can remember well over half of it is focused on the health care sector, which for us is typically pharmaceuticals, life sciences, medical devices and a lot of those companies have never used RPO before and are looking to use RPO or for whatever reason, they're unhappy with their provider and looking to switch, and we're aggressively pursuing some of those clients."
