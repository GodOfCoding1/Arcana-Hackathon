    "content": " Since the closing of the Radius acquisition in the first quarter of 2021, we have grown the bank from $2.7 billion in assets to $7.6 billion in assets, which is a compounded annual growth rate of over 70% and firmly highlights the benefits of bringing LendingClub's strength of loan originations together with the digital banking model. As expected, we saw a sequential drop from 8.3% in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to the current lag between our ability to pass along higher interest rates on new personal loans relative to the repricing of online deposits. Our provision for credit losses was $62 million, $21 million lower than the previous quarter, primarily due to a decrease in the dollar amount of loan originations held on balance sheet. Your line is now open. Second on expenses, so on the 50% variable cost market\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Sorry, just one other thing to add, Bill, is the other important part of the message we want to make sure you hear is, our intention is to maintain the balance sheet given the details we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared on the attractiveness of the loans we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re plan to continue to add. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
