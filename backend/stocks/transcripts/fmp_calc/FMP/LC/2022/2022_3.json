    "content": " First half featuring strong investor loan demand boosting originations and corresponding marketplace revenue on top of our growing net interest income revenue stream in the back half with more tempered loan volumes in marketplace revenue due to the rapidly changing rate environment, temporarily affecting loan investor demand. Our recurring revenue stream of net interest income was up 89% year-over-year, consistent with growth in loans held for investment and an increase in the consolidated net interest margin to 8.3% from 6.3% a year ago. The impact on marketplace revenue was partially offset by strong growth in net interest income, which increased 6% sequentially and as our retained loan portfolio continued to grow. Our consolidated net interest margin was 8.3% compared to 8.5% in the second quarter, reflecting a heavier mix of high-quality prime personal loans with lower coupons as well as an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. As interest rates stabilize with credit card balances and rates at or near record highs, we believe that our core business of credit card refinancing will be well-positioned to quickly resume growth and drive marketplace revenue. So, that leading into the portfolio causes some pressure on NIM, but it's not a change, but I don't want to imply there's a change enough even going further up market in terms of high quality, at least not now because we like what we see and we like the profile of what we're putting on the balance sheet at this time."
