    "content": " In the fall of 2021, GCU's traditional campus actually saw an increase of 6.2% in new students over the prior year, an increase of 9.5% in total enrollment and an increase of 25.8% in residential enrollment. The quality and relevance of our programs, the quality of GCU's campus facilities, the intense amount of faculty and counseling support, the number of campus jobs available to students, the percentage of students graduated in three years and especially the low price point all contribute to the success. Revenue per student continues to grow on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to increased room, board and other ancillary revenues from GCU students as compared to the prior year period and the growth in enrollment for hybrid students. The high end of our revenue guidance also assumed GCU Online would return to new enrollment growth in the second quarter of 2022, whereas the low end assume new starts would be down in the mid-single digits in the quarter. And so many of our students who are coming with -- GCU students are coming with 20, 30 college credits already earned that they can actually double major and do other kinds of things and graduate in three years and many will stay to do a master's degree program. Number one, you've got the huge tail -- headwind of the occupational therapy which is down roughly 30% year-over-year because they weren't allowed -- we weren't allowed to recruit any new students into that program for a very long time."
