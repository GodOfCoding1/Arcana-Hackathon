    "content": " Record Q3 orders in aerospace, defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. I think our commercial communications portfolio is a diversified one that services both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, saw broad strength across both this quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and again, continued strength for the last few years driven by 5G on the wireless side and a number of technology evolutions like 400 gig, 800 gig on the wireline side."
