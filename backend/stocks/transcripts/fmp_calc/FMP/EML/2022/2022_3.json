    "content": " Net sales from continuing operations grew to $71.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, that's an increase of 12% over the third quarter of 2021 and it's another quarterly sales record this year over Eastern's 164-year history. For the quarter, net sales from continuing operations increased 12% to $71.6 million from $63.9 million a year earlier. In the third quarter of 2022, gross margins were still 1% lower than the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix. Eastern's structural costs comprised of product development expense and selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily as a result of increased new product development, commissions and other selling costs, payroll-related expenses and travel costs. In terms of operating cash flow, the company generated approximately $2.2 million in cash from continuing operations during the third quarter 2022 compared to a use of cash of approximately $7.6 million in the third quarter of the prior year."
