    "content": " For the fourth quarter of 2022, net sales from continuing operations increased 16% to $69.1 million from $59.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022, net sales from continuing operations increased 13% to $279.3 million from $246.5 million in 2021. For the fourth quarter of 2022, net income was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $0.5 million net of tax related to a warehouse consolidation into Eberhard. During 2022, cash used to support additional working capital requirements was $5.2 million, which was primarily due to management's focus on ensuring availability of inventory to meet customer demands during current supply chain constraints. Number one, with freight costs getting back to somewhat normalcy, even though you just stated that they weren't completely, and supply chain restraints as well getting back, you were handed the baton on January 10 of this year, and it looked to me as a stakeholder that the previous management team was a train wreck in regard to the third and fourth quarter of this year."
