Customer orders were strong and importantly, our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $82.8 million stable from where it stood at the end of the second quarter of last year as well as the beginning of 2022. As such, we remain focused on the need for price adjustments across all of our businesses, most of which took effect towards the latter half of the second quarter and in the beginning of the third quarter of 2022. Product development costs increased $100,000 or 12% in the second quarter -- decreased 100,000 or 12% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the second quarter was $7.2 million compared to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2021, that represents a 24% increase in EBITDA year-over-year.
