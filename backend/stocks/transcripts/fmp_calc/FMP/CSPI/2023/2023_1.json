    "content": " The revenue and gross margin led to generating $0.21 in earnings per share, while last year, we lost $0.09 a share during the last year's fiscal first quarter. As Victor mentioned in his opening remarks, we had a solid fiscal first quarter with revenue of $18.3 million, a sizable improvement over the year ago fiscal first quarter. And with each of the revenue sources, we experienced a significant increase in product gross margin compared to the year ago fiscal first quarter level while service gross margin again surpassed 50%. Our SG&A expenses in Q1 were $3.6 million, up slightly compared to the year ago fiscal first quarter due to increased variable compensation based on higher gross margin profit. We reported net income of $1 million in the first fiscal quarter or $0.21 per diluted share compared with a loss of $366,000 or $0.09 per common share for fiscal 2022's first quarter. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $19.6 million as of December 31, 2022, which is approximately $4.4 million lower as compared to the September 30, 2022 level, primarily due to a previously referenced large financing customer sale recognized in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, but the cost was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 during the fiscal '23 first quarter.
