    "content": " That goal is to migrate to higher-margin products and services, allowing us to report a solid gross margin of 35% for the second fiscal quarter, considerably higher compared to a year-ago gross margin despite the lower revenue year-over-year. Our Technology Solution, or TS business, generated revenue of $10.9 million in the fiscal second quarter. Our execution is generating returns that is enabling CSPI to buy back shares as we repurchased nearly 13,000 shares on an average cost of $7.51 per share which I truly feel the stock is undervalued and does not reflect the many positive things we are doing and can potentially achieve in the coming quarters. We reported gross revenue of $4.2 million or 35% of sales compared to $4.3 million or 31% of sales in the year-ago fiscal second quarter, representing a 4% improvement. We reported net income of $156,000 in the fiscal second quarter or $0.03 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $847,000 or $0.20 per share for the fiscal second quarter of fiscal 2021. We ended the second -- the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $20.3 million as of March 31, 2022 which was an increase of $1 million from December 31, 2021."
