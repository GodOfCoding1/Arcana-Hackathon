    "content": " We were able to ship a sizable portion of our record fiscal Q3 backlog, which contributed to revenue growth of 67% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to prior year quarter. At the same time, the TS business segment hit on all cylinders and we achieved $0.31 per diluted common share in earnings for the fiscal year fourth quarter while continuing to generate new orders. Our high performance products, or HPP segment, which also impacted by ongoing supply chain issues during the quarter reported revenue of approximately $0.9 million, above fiscal Q3 and below the year ago fiscal Q4 amount. As Victor mentioned in his opening remarks, our fiscal fourth quarter revenue was $16.7 million, a $6.7 million or 67% increase over the year ago fiscal fourth quarter. Service revenues grew 25% compared to the year ago fourth quarter and was up from our fiscal third quarter, which is a combination of the growth in the MSP as well as a higher average selling price. Our SG&A expenses in Q4 was $4.8 million, up $1 million from the year ago fiscal fourth quarter due to increased variable compensation and bonuses from hitting key operating objectives for the full year. We reported net income of $1.4 million in the fiscal fourth quarter or $0.31 per diluted share compared with our net income, which was net income of $0.8 million or $0.19 a share -- per diluted share for the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter. We ended the fourth quarter and full year with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $24 million as of September 30, 2022, which was an increase of $4 million from September 30, 2021, primarily due to the receipt of an installment payment for a large financing order in the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter."
