    "content": " For 2023, we now expect the margin to be greater than 305 basis points; operating costs to be around GBP9.1 billion; the asset quality ratio to be circa 30 basis points; and the return on tangible equity to be circa 13%. On the pension contribution, as you say, GBP0.8 billion, GBP800 million fixed contributions we're expecting this year, that is before you get to circa 175 basis points guidance, that is already assumed in our run rate P&L, if you like, the 175 basis points is on top of that. The only -- as just the only build, because it's exactly the right question, it's what I was trying to get to when you look at the online engines playing through the balance sheet and then the business is, obviously, if you look back at Lloyds Banking Group in 2018 when they were 0% rates basically with the Bank of England, we were near 300 basis points of return on our NIM at that stage. But presumably, that's going to play out in the NIM that you print in Q1, your suggestion and some of your comments was that the Q1 in is going to be pretty firm, which makes sense given you've got the residual effect of base rate hikes, so I think your guidance probably suggests something like a 20 basis point step off in NIM in Q2, maybe 15 to 20 basis points to kind of sustain the full year guidance that you're pointing to. Firstly, interestingly, through the last 6 months and then as we look forward, there's always been smaller players, actually, the building societies and smaller banks and now some of the fintechs that have been -- they've needed to look at higher rates to attract the funding, that's not the biggest area we see our customers going actually."
