    "date": "2023-03-24 10:39:02",
    "content": " This impairment comes as a result of the company's strategic shift in focus away from clinical development and the early stage nature of the implementation of the Celyad 2.0 strategy, which involves shifting from an organization focused on clinical development to one privatizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its intellectual property portfolio through partnerships, collaboration and license agreement. Given this uncertainty, and after accounting standards, the company recognizes a full impairment loss on the remaining value of goodwill in process research and development and Horizon Discovery's shRNA platform resulting in a non-cash impairment of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac35.1 million on a consolidated basis for the financial year ended December 31, 2022."
