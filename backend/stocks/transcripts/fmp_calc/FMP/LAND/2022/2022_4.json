    "content": " But overall, our existing farmland portfolio continues to perform pretty much as expected, with the exceptions of the issues we are having with two tenants, which led us to reverse out about $1 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and so we hope to collect that in the future, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guarantees on that. Overall, the initial cash yield to us on these investments is about 5.8% and the leases on these farms contain certain provisions such as participation rents that we just mentioned and we also have annual escalations in which if you go from one year to the next year, it may be up by 3% or 4% and that should push the figures higher in the future for these farms. Excluding these three leases, lease renewals executed on our farms growing row crops are expected to result in an increase in net operating income of approximately $66,000. On the expense side, excluding reimbursable expenses and certain non-recurring or non-cash expenses, our core operating expenses increased by about $890,000 on a quarter-over-quarter basis and by about $2.5 million on a year-over-year basis. Overall, these farms increased by about $9 million or 2.5% over the previous valuations from about a year ago."
