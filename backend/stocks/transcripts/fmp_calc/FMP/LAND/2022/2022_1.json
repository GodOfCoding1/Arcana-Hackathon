    "content": " It's on 162 farms and -- we also own about 45,000 acre feet of banked water valued and all three of these together banked water as well as all these farms are worth about $1.5 billion -- and our farms are located in 15 different states, more importantly, in 29 different growing areas. The tenant there wanted to see how it worked before he signed a long-term fixed rate lease, so we're going to get 80% of the gross revenue earned on the farm this year based on current commodity prices and yield estimates, we think we'll end up in a similar place where we would have been in -- on the previous lease on this farm, but we will not know the results until the end of the year when the crops are sold. Some farmland in the grain producing states, like ones that we have are strong this year due to the lower current production stuff from Argentina, Brazil, and Ukraine and I just know that there's going to be a problem somewhere along the way because there's just not enough grain being produced in -- we'll see how that works out. And Greg, I don't know where we're going to go from here, but I think we'll be fine over the next 10, 15 years, but one has to wonder in 20 years what the West will look like if they keep using the amount of water. We had one farm in \u2013 in one of the California areas that just didn't have enough water and we spent $1 million or $1.2 million in drilling a well and didn't get as much water as we wanted, so we were really frustrated by that and found out that the city next door had a line that went across the property."
