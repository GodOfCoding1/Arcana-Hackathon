    "content": " And I believe we've lived up to that goal or 2 months providing you with deep insight into each area of our business and for the first time, last quarter, providing a detailed stage-by-stage look at our progress on certification, which we've updated in today's shareholder letter. The key area to focus on there is that we've just received approval from the FAA on our first certification plan for the flight control computer and this allows us to go and begin for credit conformity testing, which is a huge milestone that laid the blueprint for for all of the electrical systems on the aircraft, and that's going to be really the focus for us as we look to the coming quarters.

So the remaining parts are really distinct subsets parts associated with various systems like flight control systems, propulsion unit endurance system, for example, or acoustics they're in no means a representations of areas of risks or lack of product progress per se, really just a matter of time on those I'm not sure I can say more on that."
