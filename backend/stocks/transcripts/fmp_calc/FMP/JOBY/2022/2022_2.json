    "content": " During the second quarter of this year, we made important progress in all 3 of our key focus areas; type certification, scaling for early manufacturing and preparing for commercial operations. For our part, we've been working with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory to complete what we believe is the first life cycle assessment of an eVTOL aircraft's environmental footprint, including manufacturing, operations and ultimately, environmentally conscious disposal or redeployment. We would like to invite analysts and investors to our first ever Joby Field Trip on October 13 to see our facilities at the Marina Airport, where we have revitalized much of the old Fort Worth U.S. Army Airfield to support modern 21st century manufacturing and where we are continually conducting flight testing activities to support the certification of our aircraft."
