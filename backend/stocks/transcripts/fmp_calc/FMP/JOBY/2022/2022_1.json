    "content": " As well as manufacturing the majority of the large composite parts for our production-intent aircraft, we've also manufactured several more copies to be used for testing and for additional airplanes in parallel. Just like the work that's going on with our type certification for the aircraft, we're beginning to reach the execution phase of the process with our Part 135 operations certification for our on-demand service. This was $32 million higher than the first quarter of 2021 and $4.5 million above the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the continued growth in personnel to support our operations to over 1,100 employees, and R&D costs associated with building prototype parts, where we continue to make progress as highlighted by Didier."
