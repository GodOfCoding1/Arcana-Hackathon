    "content": " While cash flow in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower prices, higher consumable costs and lower grades at Palmarejo along with a $21 million noncash inventory adjustment at Rochester. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re set up for a strong fourth quarter to finish the year within our full year production and cost guidance ranges and look forward to delivering strong production and cash flow growth on the back of the Rochester expansion that is expected to be completed mid next year, followed by commissioning and ramp-up in the second half. Moving to Rochester, following a significantly improved second quarter, gold and silver production increased again, driven by strong ore placement rates in the prior period."
