    "content": " With production and cash flows expected to increase over the course of 2022, coupled with the recent actions that have significantly enhanced the balance sheet, we\u2019re confident in our ability to fully fund our growth objectives both this year and in 2023, as POA 11 construction winds down. The next biggest bucket of our CapEx this year is really underground development, capitalized development at our underground mines, which I think we\u2019ve got a good process, good controls over those buckets at Kensington and Palmarejo. And the hedge program that we put in with 70% of 2022 hedge and 50% of the first half of 2023, we\u2019ve added on a little bit more in the second half of 2023 is all geared up to just make sure we\u2019ve got that downside protection during the construction out at Rochester. And I think just one last thought there is, with everything going on in Eastern Europe, disruptions, supply disruptions, geopolitical uncertainty that\u2019s even put more of \u2013 and with the higher base metals prices has created more of a buzz around Silvertip."
