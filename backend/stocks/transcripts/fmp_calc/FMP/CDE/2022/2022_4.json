    "content": " Overall, 2023 production is expected to increase over last year driven by Rochester's stronger second half, and by an expected strong bounce back year at Wharf after a lower grade year in 2022. The conversation around here has started to transition quite noticeably less about construction activities and schedule and more about operational readiness, plans around the ramp-up schedule and everything that needs to go into ensuring that this thing ramps up smoothly throughout the back half of the year to deliver on that second half production growth and set us up for what should be a -- that inflection point in cash flow as we head into 2024. So, Mike, just to pull the lens back then, and POA 11 this year get back to positive free cash flow, lower costs, reduce debt, keep expanding that resource at Silvertip in the meantime, get to a point where we have an attractive business case at Silvertip, at which point then we can have some options to think about whether we go it alone, whether we bring in a partner, whether that's a strategic partner or a financial partner, operating JV, non-operating JV."
