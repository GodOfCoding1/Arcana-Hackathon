    "content": " Your line is now live. And we have a healthy outlook for our businesses with sustained profitability and free cash flow, so that led our Board to authorize $1 billion of share repurchases for next year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or this year, actually, 2023, and that's reflective of our capital position as we end 2022. So Erik, first, I should point out that the individual annuities market had a record year last year with over $300 billion of sales and our own individual retirement strategies business delivered strong sales and earnings, and our sales success continues to be driven by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $12 billion in sales clearly reinforcing our leadership position as a top five player in this market. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
