    "content": " Our results mark clear financial progress as we report the highest quarterly revenue in Delta's history, 3% above the third quarter of 2019 and $1.5 billion of operating income, generating a 12% margin. I think we're very, very confident in getting to 60% given that we've been less restored internationally, and internationally has actually a higher component of premium revenues and as well as the new fleets coming in and the continuation of growth at American Express and . And David, if I could add to Glen's comments, as you also appreciate, we've been, by far, the most cautious about building back our network given that we wanted to make certain we're doing it reliably, and we're doing it with our customers and our people in mind, first and foremost. And that's why I said in my remarks, I think we are uniquely positioned to do both, to grow where we haven't had the opportunity to grow as quickly as others have grown with strong demand supporting that, coupled with a significant unit cost benefit as we move forward because we already own all the assets and we already have the full staffing numbers pretty much on property. So, we're anxious to see them out, and that's going to provide them some additional opportunities to start to grow and really take advantage of the powerhouse they've become as well as the substantial reduction in cost as well as balance sheet -- reductions on debt that they've been able to achieve through the bankruptcy process. And so as people continue to see our brand evolving and want to become involved with it, whether or not it's for business or for leisure, we've seen the opportunity to continue to grow the program itself at record pace, which is very exciting and, I think, a real testament to the brand strength and all the hard work that delta people put out every day."
