And the second thing, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been talked about in the industry and we talked about it last Investor Day is not just the move from goods to service spend because our economy is a lot larger today than it was in 2019, regardless of whatever you think that GDP is, whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already into the technically mild recession or not at the present time.
