As you may recall, on February the 1 of this year, we completed the acquisition of Gap Shanghai, Gap's operations in Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, China are now a part of Baozun Brand Management, led by Sandrine Zerbib, our President of BBM and Wing Xiao, the newly appointed CEO of Gap Greater China. Today's digital transformation, in fact every aspect of business in general and of brand business in particular, from integration of online and offline stores, increasing share of marketing budgets to digital marketing and the accelerating use of big data and AI in brands product creation cycle and customer relationship. Please ask your question, Violet. That's also why for the time being we focus more on apparel, footwear accessory brands, because again, everything we're doing in terms of logistics, e-commerce operation and technology, particularly with regards to supply chain, as well as leveraging the resources we have recruited for the recovery of Gap Greater China are going to be usable for other brands when we remain in this area in this segment of business. Please ask your question, Violet. For BECs, our goal always to put the customer first, and to provide the value added service, which is the whole business where we will remain focused and we believe given our expertise and experience in this area and given the e-commerce overall dynamics in China, we still have a huge potential to keep growing in the top line and bottom line for this business unit."
