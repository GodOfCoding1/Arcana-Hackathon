    "content": " Water Infrastructure orders in the quarter were up 12% organically versus last year, with growth underpinned by sustained demand in our wastewater utility business in the U.S. and Western Europe and increasing demand for dewatering, particularly in emerging markets. And Mike, I would just -- I would offer up, I think to your question around visibility from an overall market sentiment standpoint, our bidding pipeline, especially in the treatment and on the wastewater side being treatment and even on the clean water side being metrology, we've got visibility there and a bidding pipeline of at least 2 to 3 years out. But I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the customers understand that there are a few other alternatives and these implementations have gone through such a rigorous long-range regulatory approvals, and they're so critical to their own revenue generation capability that as long as we're able to meet their kind of basic demand as best we can and give them as full transparency as possible, we've been very proud and very pleased in working with them as well as with our chip suppliers. I think I heard you say during your prepared comments that you had increased your assumption for inflation I'm just wondering whatever other metrics you can give us around pricing would be helpful, whether it's where you're expecting that ramp to go in the second quarter, what your full year pricing will be because the gap is still pretty large right now."
