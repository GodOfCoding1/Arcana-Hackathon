    "content": " So as you've seen in this morning's release, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 8% to 10% growth for the full year, and we're raising the bottom end of our EPS range by $0.10. Your line is open. Your line is open. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the expected profitability of that business as we see revenue pick up in the third quarter, and then you've talked about a bigger step-up in the fourth quarter, assuming that it's probably going to continue to improve going into next year. I think one thing, I would call out is that, if you look at our dewatering business, for example, which is more industrial, we've done a lot to diversify the end markets there, much less exposure to oil and gas than we did in the prior recession. Again, I would just offer up, Nathan, you publicly recall this, but if you go back over time, and look at previous kind of industrial recessions back in kind of the 2015, 2016 timeframe, our European business still held up in terms of growth during that timeframe, because the results are much less cyclical there given the end market exposure that we've got. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
