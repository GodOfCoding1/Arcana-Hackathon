    "content": " As a result, revenues grew globally, high teens in the U.S. and mid-teens in emerging markets in Western Europe on strong price and backlog execution as supply chains modestly improved. Underlying demand for our AMI offerings remains strong and orders continue to outpace revenue, yielding backlog growth of 35% versus the prior year. Looking at the industrial end market, we now expect low double-digit growth lifted from a previous range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth, driven by strong global demand for dewatering and continued underlying demand for our solutions in the U.S. and Western Europe. But where you're really going to see the strength come through continued is in the Water Infrastructure resilience because of utility demand and again, the conversion of chip supply on M&CS and given the deals that we've gotten back on. So it's a real combination of factors and the good news is we've seen some uptick in the revenue, a little bit of a flattening from Q2 to Q3 and we'll expect that continued moderation and then another kind of step up more in the back half of next year."
