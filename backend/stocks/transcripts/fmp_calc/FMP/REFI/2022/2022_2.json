    "content": " We are currently anticipating that Q3 and Q4, absent any additional increase in the facility would look a lot like Q2 with adjusted distributable earnings in the range of $1 to $1.05 for the second half of 2022, that would equate to $1.95 to $2 for the full-year of 2022. Yes, I think that's a good point noting that our risk ratings have increased across the portfolio, this isn't related to any specific borrower or any particular issue related to a borrower, but rather is related to general market conditions with interest rates and spreads, I mean, I think John mentioned earlier that kind of a tale of two cities. So overall, we think the credit quality of our borrowers is strong in the states that we're in, but we just don't want to ignore what's going on with the broader market within our portfolio."
