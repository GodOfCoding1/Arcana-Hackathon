    "content": " Year-to-date, we have had two payoffs totaling $3.6 million, resulting in a total of $337 million of commitments and a weighted average yield to maturity of 17.5% as of May 10th. And as Tony noted a moment ago, as of May 10, the portfolio has grown to $337 million with a yield of 17.5%. While the interest income of $9.8 million increased sequentially from $5.8 million in Q4, we expect to see the full effect of the deployment of IPO proceeds and the use of the credit facility in Q2."
