    "content": " I would also highlight that U.S. retail sales estimates from stock book project cannabis sales to increase from $30 billion in 2022 to $53 billion by 2026 with Rhode Island approving adult use cannabis in May and its first retail store opening in early December and with Maryland being expected to move to adult use with the referendum this month, these estimates may, in fact, be conservative. As expected, net interest income continued to increase sequentially, up $1.5 million or 13.4% from Q2. Total operating expenses for the quarter were consistent with Q2 at approximately $2.9 million, which includes management and incentive fees of $1.3 million, aggregate G&A and professional fees of $1.4 million and stock-based compensation of approximately $100,000. We anticipate full year G&A will be approximately $3.5 million, which includes costs associated with our upsized credit facility, which were not capitalizable under GAAP. As of quarter end, we increased our provision for expected credit losses by $300,000 or nearly $0.02 per weighted average diluted common share."
