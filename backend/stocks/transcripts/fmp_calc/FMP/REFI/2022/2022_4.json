    "content": " As we discuss on our last call, we believe we reset the pricing among cannabis operators by serving as the lead and agent for a new four-year $350 million facility for our largest multi-state operator. In the period subsequent to year-end, we received approximately $6.5 million in early principal repayments and raised another $6 million in equity capital last month. As discussed last quarter, the incentive fee is calculated on a rolling 12-month basis and in Q4 2022, the impact of the prior year incentive fee waiver of $1.1 million in connection with our IPO is no longer a reduction to the annual incentive fee calculation. Adjusted distributable earnings per share was $0.57 per diluted share for Q4 and $2.11 for the year ended December 31st, 2022. The decrease of $0.14 per common share was primarily due to the increased provision for expected credit losses of $2.5 million to a total reserve of approximately $4 million at December 31st, 2022. I think our portfolio is very robust as you will see -- kind of like I mentioned, we've committed to $0.47 a share per quarter, and we're also committed to distributing 90% to 100%."
