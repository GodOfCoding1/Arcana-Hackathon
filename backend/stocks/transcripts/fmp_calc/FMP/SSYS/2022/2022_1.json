    "content": " For the first quarter, total revenue was $163.4 million, a 21.8% increase from the prior year period, driven by growth from all technologies and primarily by strength in systems. Product revenue in the first quarter was $113.1 million, an increase of 45.2% compared to the same period last year or 27.8% on a constant currency basis. Within product revenue, system revenue increased 36.7% to $54.5 million compared to the same period last year and increased by 39.3% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, the higher margin consumable business showed revenue increase by 16.1% to $58.6 million compared to the same period last year, an increase by 18.8% on a constant currency basis. Service revenue was $50.3 million, an increase of 14.8% compared to the same period last year, and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2019. The $10.1 million year-over-year increase in operating expenses on an absolute basis was driven primarily by the impact of three acquisitions Xaar 3D, Origin, and RPS, as well as higher commission based on higher revenue. In 2022, we continue to expect our operating expenses to be approximately $20 million to $25 million higher than 2021, primarily due to the impact of owning Xaar 3D for the full year, higher costs that result from higher sales and investment in new growth driver, such as Origin One and health care.
