    "content": " In Endometrial cancer, we are excited to be moving forward with a novel biomarker-driven Phase III study by leveraging the potential substantial benefit of Selinexor that we've observed in patients that are TP53 wild-type. Since XPOVIO's first approval in 2019, we have utilized real-world experience, coupled with observations from our own clinical trials demonstrate that lower doses of Selinexor can optimize the patient benefit by improving its tolerability, which ultimately allows patients to stay on therapy longer and therefore, improve their overall benefit. Net product revenue from U.S. commercial sales of XPOVIO for the full year 2022 was $120.4 million, meeting our guidance for the year compared to $98.4 million for the full year 2021, representing a 22% increase year-over-year. So based upon a November 2022 cut, we reanalyzed the progression-free survival, specifically in those P53 wild-type patients, which comprise approximately 50% of all Endometrial cancer and very encouraged by the updated results."
