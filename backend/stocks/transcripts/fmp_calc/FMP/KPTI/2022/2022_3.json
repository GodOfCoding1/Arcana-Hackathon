    "content": " This pipeline is comprised of mid and late-stage clinical development programs that is being purposefully built and strategically focused to help patients who suffer from cancers with high unmet need, to demonstrate efficacy at lower doses with improved tolerability and where we believe, we will have the highest probability of success. Since XPOVIO is launched in 2019, we have utilized real-world experience coupled with observations from our clinical trials to demonstrate that lower doses of selinexor can optimize the patient benefit by improving its tolerability, which will ultimately allow patients to remain on therapy longer improving their overall benefit. As you can see on slide 14, we are excited to announce that we have initiated the Phase 3 maintenance study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor in TP53 wild-type patients with stage four or recurrent endometrial cancer and expect to dose the first patient in the fourth quarter. But that allows us again to be able to develop selinexor in the widest patient population of myelofibrosis really why we are focused on both the treatment-naive opportunity in combination with ruxolitinib, but also as a monotherapy in those patients that have been treated with at least six months of prior JAK inhibition."
