    "content": " Loan originations, excluding PPP, totaled $50 million for the first quarter, nearly doubled a year earlier level and commercial line utilization increased to 38% of total commitment from 34% at year end. Net income also compared favorably to 8.9 million and $0.66 per share in the first quarter of '21, despite much larger provision reversals last year. The 7.9 million increase in net interest income over first quarter '21 was reflective of the ARB merger, a larger allocation of the loan portfolio to higher rate loans, a deployment of cash into investment securities and the costs associated with the early redemption of subordinated debt in 2021. First quarter '22 relative to Q1 '21 reflects a higher expense base from the acquisition, most notably salaries and related benefits of 2.3 million due to increased numbers of employees, regularly scheduled annual merit increases and lower deferred loan origination costs. The improving operating leverage of Bank of Marin is evident in our 57.5% efficiency ratio, excluding merger-related one-time and conversion costs compared to 64.6% in the first quarter of 2021. During the first quarter, our strong liquidity position enabled us to transfer 358 million in available-for-sale securities to our held-to-maturity portfolio to partially insulate other comprehensive income and equity from future changes in interest rates. We'll continue to look at that because of the ongoing impact of rising rates on the securities portfolio and AOCI and the deposits, but it's certainly something we're keenly interested in going forward."
