    "content": " Year-to-date, net interest income of $94 million was more than 25% higher than the first three quarters of 2021. At the end of the third quarter, our loan portfolio had only $7.6 million remaining in PPP loans, net of $161,000 in unrecognized fees and costs. As we continue to integrate and build on our most recent acquisitions, efficiency ratio illustrates - integrate and build on our most recent acquisition, the efficiency ratio illustrate  quarter and year-to-date respectively, both improved from 55.7% in the prior quarter and 65.7% in the first 9 months of 2021, as there were substantially more acquisition-related expenses in the comparable period. September 30, tangible common equity of 7.5% for Bancorp and 7.3% for Bank of Marin were down 24 and 53 basis points respectively due to a $22 million increase in after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities associated with rising interest rates during the third quarter, partially offset by earnings. And I just wanted to get your sense, and that's a tough number to peg, but given where we are with rates, do you think that that headwind going forward - I mean, the trend linked quarter was down quite a bit."
