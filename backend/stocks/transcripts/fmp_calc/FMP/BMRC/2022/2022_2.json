    "content": " While our production was strong, total loans decreased modestly in the quarter due to expected construction project completions and borrower sales of underlying commercial real estate and business assets, PPP loan payoffs and third-party refinancing of acquired loans outside the bank's credit risk appetite. With noninterest-bearing deposits of 53% of total deposits, the average cost of deposits was just 6 basis points, unchanged from the prior quarter and better by 1 basis point on a year-to-date basis. Return on assets of 1.03% and return on equity of 10.74% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, would have been 1.05% and 10.95%, respectively, without onetime and conversion costs related to the 2021 merger with American River Bank. Tim covered the major changes in the loan portfolio, and I will just add that we held 112 PPP loans totaling $17 million net of $420,000 in unrecognized season costs at the end of the quarter. June 30, 2022, tangible common equity of 7.8% for Bancorp and 7.5% for Bank of Marin were down 24 and 53 basis points, respectively, due to an increase in after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities associated with rising interest rates during the second quarter. I'm guesstimating it's about $300,000 based on the core loan yield comment of being up 10 basis points in the PPP contribution in the quarter."
