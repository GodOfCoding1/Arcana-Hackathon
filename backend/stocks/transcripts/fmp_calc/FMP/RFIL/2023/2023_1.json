    "content": " Even though our first quarter is our seasonally slowest period, we anticipated shipping an additional $1.4 million in orders that were delayed due to customer requests and timing of shipments, and will be recognized in future quarters. As Rob mentioned, sales in the first quarter, which seasonally is our lowest quarter of the year were $18.3 million and included a $5.1 million contribution from Microlab products. This represents a year-over-year increase of $1.4 million or 8.3%/ We experienced lower sales in our project business to wireless carriers as compared to the prior year relating to our hybrid fiber, small cell, and DAC products. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so from a West Coast perspective, there's some meaningful investment to do it that will allow us to take out, you know over the long-term the operating savings, but we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to get in here, it's probably give or take $1 million."
