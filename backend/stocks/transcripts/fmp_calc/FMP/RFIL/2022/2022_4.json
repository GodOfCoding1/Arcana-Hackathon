    "content": " Our go to market strategies and business development efforts have generated significant multimillion dollar orders from existing and new customers, which combined with our steady distribution centric core business led to much of our growth and resulted in a continued healthy backlog of $27.8 million as we entered the new fiscal year. It's hard to know if all the projects that we're doing, specifically on the hybrid fiber side are going to stay at the exact same level, but our expectation is, those will continue to be robust, maybe not at the same level they were last year and we need some other product areas to increase to offset that to give us the growth. I'm not rushing into any deals and whether that -- whether that continues to be the case this full year or not, we'll have to wait and see, but I don't think it's a very -- while people are interested in talking about M&A, it's a little bit of a funky environment to be going out to find capital. If our core business, if we start to see some things normalized there where some of the costs come down a hair, both on cost of goods and cost of labor, we can start to see better gross margins there and then with the new product areas, although that's Microlab or others, if the mix starts to swing heavier in that direction, we absolutely believe there's an opportunity to get those margins up into the mid-30s."
