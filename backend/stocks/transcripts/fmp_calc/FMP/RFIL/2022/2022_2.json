    "content": " Sales for the quarter came in at $21.5 million, a 27% increase sequentially from Q1 and a 94% increase over the second quarter last year. And with this expected 40% increase in full-year revenue versus fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect significant growth in our adjusted EBITDA as our profitability increases through the remainder of the year with the goal of getting back to 30% gross margins and getting 10% of sales dropping through to adjusted EBITDA. Sales in the second quarter were $21.5 million, up 27% sequentially from the first quarter and up 94% from the second quarter last year or up 64%, excluding Microlab sales. And with this expected 40% increase in full-year revenue versus fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect our profitability to continue to further improve throughout the remainder of the year with the goal of getting back to 30% gross margins and getting 10% of sales dropping through to adjusted EBITDA. When we're talking, Schroff Tech integrated small cell cabinets, that's a much easier thing to quantify, which we're seeing growth from a few million bucks and sort of when we made that acquisition, we're expecting that to grow certainly into next year, but what is harder to quantify is a lot of Microlab products go into small cell deployments."
