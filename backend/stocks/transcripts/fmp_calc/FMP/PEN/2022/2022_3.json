    "content": " We significantly increased our non-GAAP operating income to $7.8 million, representing 3.7% of revenue in the third quarter, which does not yet include any material benefit from the reorganization of our immersive healthcare business that we did during the second quarter. For the third quarter end of September 30, 2022, our total revenues were $213.7 million, an increase of 12.4% reported and 15.1% in constant currencies compared to the third quarter of 2021, with current year-to-date foreign exchange headwind of $11.6 million and projected full year foreign exchange headwind of $18 million to $19 million. Revenue from our vascular business grew to $123.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 17% reported and 18.8% in constant currency compared to the same period last year. Revenue from our Neuro business was $90.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 6.7% reported and 10.5% in constant currency compared to the same period a year ago, driven by growth in the neuro thrombectomy franchise. Moving to 2023, we expect Lightning Flash, Lightning Bolt, and Thunderbolt will fuel accelerating growth and drive significant share gain in PE, venous, arterial and stroke thrombectomy respectively, first in the United States, then around the world in 2024 and beyond. Please go ahead, your line is open. Just to follow-up a little bit on that, with respect to your question about sort of the cadence, certainly we are very excited and I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect Lightning Flash to be the most successful product launch in our company's history to date when it's launched. Yes, it's a great question. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Yes, it's a great question. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
