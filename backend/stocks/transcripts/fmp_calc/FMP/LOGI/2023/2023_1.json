    "content": " In fact, if you look back over the last several years by going back to FY2020, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve returned about $1.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been roughly 50-50, a little bit more weighted towards share repurchases, to your point, recently I think about 60% over that time share repurchases. On to comment on gaming, I think specifically, Alex, if we went back and looked at our Analyst Day a couple of years ago, so this is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I thought the gaming market or our gaming business might be kind of flat year-over-year after a really strong FY2021 at plus or minus 5%. And we'll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we've got great market share and we're gaining market share there, but I'm not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I wouldn't point to that one and say, gosh, that's one to really look at as a bellwether for how our business going to do. Well, I think on the impairment thing, obviously that's something we look at every quarter and we have taken reserves in the P&L really over the last year, I would say, including some this quarter, we didn't have very many of those during the height of the pandemic growth period because everything was selling, but we've sort of been reverting to more normal levels of reserves, I think over the last 12 months. I think we're also just, I mean, you know this, because you've been following us for a while, but I'll say for everybody else, we're not in a business that has big obsolescence risk where some new technology's going to come in and really obsolete our category."
