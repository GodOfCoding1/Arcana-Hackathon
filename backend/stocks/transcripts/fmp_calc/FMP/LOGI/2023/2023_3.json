    "content": " I think we're in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're probably in the middle of the most uncertain period right now, because it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the New Year just started. I think, it's too early for us to tell you what next year is going to look like and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but hopefully, we'll have a clear picture of that when we come into March. But I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I'm pretty optimistic about somewhere out there in the next \u00e2\u0080\u0093 over the next year or so that you'll see the market come back, but I think everybody on this call has an opinion on how long this is going to last. What you think you have in visibility, suddenly, it's -- seems like it's been pushed out a quarter or two or something. And again, I think the diversification in our business is really key to us being able to deliver a good strong quarter in what's the challenging macro environment. Well, first, I would say, we're trying to unlearn our consumer vertical into the B2B because I think our strength in consumer is something that really doesn't lend itself too much to the B2B side right now. And maybe if you're really an optimist, then I'll stay away from going too far on this, but I think you can imagine it's become more central to our lives as part of our homes and things."
