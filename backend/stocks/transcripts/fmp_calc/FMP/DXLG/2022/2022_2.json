    "content": " I'm pleased to report that we achieved a comparable sales growth rate of plus 6.1% in Q2 versus 2021 and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.9% and a net income of $0.85 per share, which includes a onetime tax benefit that we are recognizing in Q2 due to the release of our tax valuation allowance. While we've seen flat traffic in Q2, which we believe is attributable to overall macroeconomic pullbacks in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, this is being offset and bolstered by increased average order values driven by DXL's brand, promotional repositioning, merchandise mix shifts and our lower clearance levels. Noah, your line is now open. Noah, your line is now open."
