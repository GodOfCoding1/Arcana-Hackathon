We call this a brand ethos and because it is much bigger than an idea, bigger than an advertising campaign, it's an ethos because it really informs everything we do moving forward, how we make our site and the stores a haven for him, how we relentlessly strive to serve his fit and style, how we build the strategies, how we build our plans and buy our assortment, how we design our stores and our website, how we engage our guests and how we ultimately serve the needs of our big and tall customers. The assortment we have is moderate, upper moderate, and beyond that, or if you think about it in good, better, best terms, it's better and best and really, the nature of that is Ralph Lauren is one of our greatest brands, Vineyard Vines, Lacoste, those brands are great value, but they're in more upper moderate price point better and best in, and there's an opportunity, represented by some of the things we're doing with things like the DXL BTE program, which is the big Intel Essentials program, which is product that we feel very proud of."
