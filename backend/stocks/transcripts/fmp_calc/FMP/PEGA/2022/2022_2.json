    "content": " Your line is open. So, the one thing that we are seeing and we've seen it probably for a couple of quarters, but I think it's -- we're starting to realize that clients really are transitioning into more leaning more towards consumption-based buying patterns, right, which means that they're looking at like kind of almost we like a minimum commit with variable usage as they drive additional usage. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And we're going to create a largely virtual team, but we're not going to commingle that at all, with the kind of go-to-market and the current messaging, you know, we see that as a separate product, using experience, obviously, that we've had for many, many years to inform it, that will go to market through a separate channel as a partner sold channel -- sold by actual organizations that have the IP that they want to sell. Your line is open. But the reality is, as they move into, say, the medical field as they recently have done in a greater quantity, and as they move into, or they obviously deep in retail, that means that certain of the very large clients that we want to sell to have, well, less attraction to using them as a platform, it doesn't actually impact visible to a customer, whether they're running the Pega Cloud on Amazon, or on Google, but some companies have their own standards and their objectives in that regard."
