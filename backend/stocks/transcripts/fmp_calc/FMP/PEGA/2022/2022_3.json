    "content": " In our experience, many large enterprise clients consolidate vendors during times like these, which is one of the reasons why we're currently focusing less on capturing new logos as we believe, given high inflation and economic uncertain outlook, enterprises will focus even more on automation and digital transformation for efficiency gains, a demand catalyst for our intelligent automation product portfolio. This is by far the best quarter we've had this year given the combination of growth in ACV, Pega Cloud and backlog, while at the same time, we're making progress managing the business and much more of a focus on operational discipline and profitable growth as we progress on our journey to achieve the Rule of 40 as we exit 2024. I would say in 2022 and going forward, that's less impactful within a quarter or a year compared to what it was, say, in 2018, when a 10% shift would impact us immediately by $40 million or $50 million against a number that was much smaller in terms of Pega's revenue. The additions to the app factory capabilities, which we're already seeing some excellent adoption of where it makes it easy for organizations to put in automation, but do it on a platform that has enterprise scale capabilities as opposed to a little stand-alone things, which -- but candidly, I think some of the other players in the low-code space are more likely to be kind of the reincarnation of Lotus Notes, as you know what that was five years ago, and being able to tell organizations that we can give you a structured way, but also a way that's fast and that builds on things that may be familiar to you."
