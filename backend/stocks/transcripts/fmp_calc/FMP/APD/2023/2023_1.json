    "content": " The items that you need to consider to make a fair comparison versus last year are a $0.15 negative impact from currency, and a one-time gain of $0.20 in the first quarter of last year from the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture. We were pleased to announce in January 19, the completion of the second phase of the $12 million Jazan gasification and power project, which is 51% maturity owned by Air Products, and it is 60% project financed. During the first quarter, with the first phase of this project, which was completed in October of 2021, Air Products contributed around $0.5 billion for the purchase of $7.1 billion of assets from Saudi Aramco. This means that Air Products -- this project financing means that now our cash contribution to this project will be $800 million, less than $800 million, which is significantly less than the $1.7 billion that we originally expected. Then in addition, we have further increased the investment by $1.2 billion to include  service from other people, but now we want to provide those services ourselves in order to make the project totally self-contained and we wouldn't be dependent on others. Although our share of the ongoing Jazan gasification and power joint venture net profit added to the region's results, the equity affiliates' income declined by $28 million primarily due to the one-time benefit associated with the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization in the first quarter of last year. We are, right now, almost sold out of that project, and they are getting a significant premium, yes, because Exxon through their subsidiary, which we have announced this publicly, so I'm not putting anything new to their ancillary, which is the inferior Chemical Limited, they are going to use the blue hydrogen we give them to produce renewable diesel that they're going to sell in California at premium prices."
