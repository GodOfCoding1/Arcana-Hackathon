    "content": " You'll note, the significant improvement over the years and please also note that about three-quarters of the recent decline is due to higher pass-through energy costs that increase our sales, but not our properties. EBITDA margin of 33.9% decreased 360 basis points compared to the prior year, as positive contributions from price, equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher energy pass-through, which lowered EBITDA margin by 500 basis points. Volume was up 2%, as we continue to successfully bring on a stream -- being on a stream a small to medium-sized traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business across the region, which more than offset the reduced merchant volumes caused by COVID restrictions in certain parts of China in the last quarter. Compared to Q1 of this year, Europe's operating income has improved $40 million or 40% and EBITDA margin has increased by over 600 basis points, owing much to our team's successful pricing effort. Seifi, as we discussed when I first shared my decision with you I remain fully supportive of Air Products' growth strategy, continuing to focus on our very strong base business, while we further advanced our unique first-mover advantages driving the sustainability-focused energy transition for the world will no doubt create significant value for our investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders."
