    "content": " Last quarter, despite the very difficult conditions caused by war, significant inflation in energy costs, supply chain disruptions and lingering effects of the COVID-19 virus, our people delivered strong results with an earnings per share of $2.38, which is 14% higher than the previous year. EBITDA increased 9%, our third consecutive quarter exceeding the $1 billion mark as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38, which is $0.30 or 14% above last year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digital year-over-year revenue growth and a testament to the stability, resilience and growth of our business model. EBITDA jumped 17% sequentially, and EBITDA margin improved 380 basis points as strong price higher equity affiliate income and lower non-energy-related costs more than compensated for the lower volume. EBITDA margin was 460 basis points lower than the previous year due to higher costs, negative volume mix and reduced equity affiliate income, which were partially offset by better price. Even with these challenges, for quarter three fiscal year 2022, our opening per share guidance is $2.55 to $2.65, up 10% to 15% over last year and almost $0.20 higher than last quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
