    "content": " We produced a record $295 million of EBITDA in the quarter, over 37% ahead of pro forma 2019 with strong margins and we achieved our recently increased cost synergy goal well ahead of schedule. Turning to other segments, NOG was 3.8% with Diamond adding 1,900 new members in the quarter, bringing our member base up to 515,000, that's well another quarter of revenue improvement in our resort and club business, and our rental business also produced sequential revenue growth supporting our view that the leisure travel environment remains robust. VPG was just over 4,200 for the quarter, as we've discussed before, as new buyer tour flow continues to recover towards 2019 levels, we've seen an expected normalization of our VPGs from the historic highs we've seen over the past 24-months, but we continue to expect that VPGs will stabilize roughly 10% to 15% ahead of 2019 levels, due to our new product offering and efficiency initiatives. With regards to our portfolio, the good news is, it's still outperforming not only last year, but 2019 levels and if we look at delinquency rates, compared to 2019, we're still in excess of the Diamond side still in excess of 100 basis points better than where they were in \u00e2\u0080\u009819 in HGV just under that -- just around 60 basis points better."
