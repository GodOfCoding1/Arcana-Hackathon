    "content": " We expect US shale production, led by the Permian, will continue to be crucial to supplying and meeting global energy demand with Plains' integrated system and business model well positioned to benefit and generate significant multiyear free cash flow. The increase is driven by several factors, including the benefit of improved frac spreads and volumes in our NGL business and improvements in our crude oil segment, including increased volumes benefiting our Permian system as well as higher pricing on pipeline loss allowance barrels, partially offset by reduced merchant opportunities. Our integrated business model and asset base allows us to move energy to multiple markets safely, reliably and responsibly and will benefit from any production accelerating beyond our current expectations, whether it's capturing additional growth or improved long-haul margins from current market levels today. We've continued to optimize our asset base, focused our business by completing over $4.5 billion of noncore asset sales and created additional alignment through 15 JV strategic joint ventures and most recently, forming the Permian gathering JV, which is a system backed by 4 million long-term dedicated acres."
