    "content": " We reported second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $615 million, which includes the benefit of higher straddle plant volumes at Empress due to increased gas order flows, elevated commodity prices benefiting our pipeline allowance revenue and higher volumes on our Permian Basin long-haul pipelines, primarily flows on basin pipeline to Cushing. Our updated guidance is $175 million above our initial February estimates, largely as a result of higher commodity prices and frac spreads benefiting our C3+ spec product sales and volumes in our NGL segment as well as increased prices on pipeline loss allowance barrels and incremental Permian volumes in the crude oil segment. But I'd see on an absolute margin standpoint just because of ownership of basin relative to the others, we're somewhat indifferent between the 2 on -- even if it's a slightly lower tariff to Cushing because we own 100% of the -- our basin capacity versus what effectively with the Eagle Ford JV is 75% and then 65% on Cactus II. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. On the crude side, the market side of deep it's on the liquids or the gas side, but we're going to remain disciplined, and we'll see opportunities that the footprint we have affords us an ability to extract more synergies than most from a capital standpoint, from an operating expense standpoint and from a commercial standpoint."
