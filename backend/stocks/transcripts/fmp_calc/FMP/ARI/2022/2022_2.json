    "content": " Shifting to the portfolio ARI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loan portfolio, totaled $8.9 billion at quarter end, a 19% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Credit quality remains stable and as evidenced by the repayments in the quarter, our borrowers continue to achieve business plans and have access to capital to refinance our loans. We call it several $100 million of liquidity, I think for us, as we think about that liquidity, and how aggressively we want to put it into new deployment, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part driven by opportunities that we see in the market. And I think, generally speaking to comments I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made on prior earnings calls, I would say newly created office space is generally getting an audience, as I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many companies still in the mindset of, in order to get people back to the office, you need to offer them more modern, more highly amenitized office space. Stuart, short-term rates are probably, everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worried about the economy, longer term, but I think short term rates are sort of top of mind, for the market and 150  now on LIBOR, maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re 350  by the end of the year, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty significant impact of a couple hundred basis points when you making an $100 million loans to people."
