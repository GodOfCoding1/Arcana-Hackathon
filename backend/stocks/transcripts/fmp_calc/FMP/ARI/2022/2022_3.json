    "content": " It is worth noting that even with a positive move in the stock this morning, ARI's current quarterly dividend run rate of $0.35 per share, ARI is paying common stockholders a 13-plus percent annualized yield while trading at approximately 70% of book value with earnings supported by our portfolio consisting of 98% floating rate loans. In addition, the company sold down approximately $328 million of a future funding obligation for one of ARI's largest UK loans, which is financing the construction of a mixed-use property in a prime Central London location. In addition, ARI's general CECL allowance decreased by $2.6 million, primarily due to portfolio seasoning and previously mentioned sale of the unfunded commitments in our loan secured with a mixed-use asset and land."
