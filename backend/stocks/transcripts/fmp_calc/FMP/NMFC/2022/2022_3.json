    "content": " Our net asset value was $13.20 per share, just a $0.22 or 1.6% decrease despite the rising interest rate environment as some gains on individual positions such as Haven helped offset the impact of rising interest rates on existing loans. On the left side of the page, we show the current state of the portfolio where we have $3.2 billion of investments at fair value with $59 million or 1.8% of the portfolio currently on nonaccrual. This results in quarterly NII of $32.5 million or $0.32 per weighted average share, which exceeded our Q3 regular dividend of $0.30 per share, as a result of the net unrealized depreciation in the quarter but an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $7.7 million. If I look at the forward curve today at 5% versus where your effective rate was at the end of the third quarter, it's 5% versus the 2.2%, you're talking about almost 300 basis points of potential rising rates, which my back of the envelope math would equate to about 0.7, 0.8x of lower interest coverage from your 2.1 today."
