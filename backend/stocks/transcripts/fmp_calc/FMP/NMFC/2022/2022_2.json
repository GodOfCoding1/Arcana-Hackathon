    "content": " Our net asset value was $13.42 per share a $0.14 or just 1.0% decrease from last quarter's net asset value, largely due to widening credit spreads in the market. As you can see, given our portfolios strong bias towards defensive sectors like software, business services, and health care, we believe the vast majority of our assets are well positioned to continue to perform no matter how the economic landscape develops, we continue to spend significant time and energy on our remaining red and orange name, which now represents just 2.4% of our portfolio at fair value. For example, on a go forward basis, if base rate settings averaged 2%, NMFC's annual net investment income will increase by $0.04 per share all other variables being equal. At 3%, LIBORs NMFC's run rate earnings power would be approximately 11% higher, representing an incremental $0.14 cents per share. On the lower half of the page, we focus on below the line items where we show that since inception, highlighted in blue, we have a cumulative net realized gain of 17.2 million, which is approximately $15 million improvement compared to last quarter as a result of certain opportunistic sales in our net lease portfolio that we disclosed last quarter."
