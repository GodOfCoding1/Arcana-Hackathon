    "content": " We believe our portfolio continues to be very well positioned overall.\\ The updated heat maps show the positive risk migration this quarter, as summarized on page nine and with four positions representing $168 million of fair value improving in rating and three positions representing $33 million, worsening in rating. As you can see, given our portfolio's strong bias towards defensive sectors like software, business services and health care, we believe the vast majority of our assets are very well positioned to continue to perform no matter how the economic landscape develops. On the right side of the page, we present NMFC's cumulative credit performance since our inception in 2008, which shows that across $9.4 billion of total investments only $276 million have been placed on non-accrual. On the lower half of the page, we focus on below-the-line items, where we show that since inception, highlighted in blue, we have a cumulative net realized gain of $2.3 million, which is a $17.6 million improvement compared to last quarter as a result of the partial sale of the Arctic Glacier position from our real estate portfolio. Given the very low cap rates on certain seasoned assets in Q4 of 2021, we made the strategic decision to sell a meaningful portion of the portfolio, which has yielded sales in Q1 and Q2 and of approximately $67 million creating a realized gain of approximately $43 million. We thought that it was a relevant statistic because fundamentally, if the business is performing well and obviously given the very attractive loan to values that John talked about in the market section, sponsors are not going to walk away in our view generally speaking of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of cash equity over what is a relatively small dollar amount for 1%, 2% change in interest burden."
