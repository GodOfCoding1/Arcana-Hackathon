    "content": " Adjusted net investment income for the third quarter was $0.35 per share, more than covering our $0.32 dividend per share that was paid in cash on December 30. Based on our view of Q1 earnings, we expect that our first supplemental dividend will be $0.02 to $0.03 per share, raising our next dividend to $0.34 to $0.35 per share all-in and to be potentially more in future quarters. On the left side of the page, we show the current state of the portfolio, where we have $3.2 billion of investments at fair value, with $58 million or 1.8% of the portfolio currently on non-accrual. As you can see at the top of the page, since our initial listing, NMFC has paid approximately $1.1 billion of regular dividends to our shareholders, which have been fully supported by over $1.1 billion of adjusted net investment income. On the bottom of the page, in yellow, we show how cumulative net realized and unrealized loss stands at just $67 million, which remains a tiny fraction of the $1.1 billion of net investment income we have generated since our IPO. The portfolio had over $3.2 billion in investments at fair value at December 31 and total assets of $3.4 billion, with total liabilities of $2 billion, of which total statutory debt outstanding was $1.7 billion, excluding $300 million of drawn SBA-guaranteed debentures. Total net expenses were approximately $51.2 million, a $5.6 million increase quarter-over-quarter due primarily to higher base rates on our floating rate debt. The majority of the one-time items relate to NHME which has been a challenging investment that we have marked down by 80% during 2022 to a carrying value of only $5.4 million, which represents just 0.4% of current NAV. This results in 2022 total adjusted net investment income of $128 million or $1.28 per weighted average share, which more than covered our $1.22 regular dividend paid in 2022."
