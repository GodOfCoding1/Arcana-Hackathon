    "content": " In the cabotage business, Q4 2022 adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.9 million to $0.4 million due to more operating days of the fleet as the market environment in Argentina has improved compared to the prior year, following recovery of the demand after the end of the lockdown. For Q4 2022, the adjusted loss was $12 million compared to $20.2 million loss in the same period last year, mainly due to lower finance cost and an income tax benefit on the Argentinian operations."
