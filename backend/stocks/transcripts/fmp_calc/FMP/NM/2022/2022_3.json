Port segment adjusted EBITDA grew 32% to $25.8 million, mainly driven by a 38% increase in the grain port throughput attributed to higher Uruguayan export of soybeans higher tariffs at the iron ore port terminal following the annual inflation adjustments embedded into our Vale contract, as well as increased iron ore throughput from the clients 4B Mining and Vetria. In the  segment, Q3 2022 adjusted EBITDA decreased 73% to $0.5 million, mainly due to low demand on dry cargo. In the cabotage business, Q3 2022 adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million to $2.9 million due to more operating days of the fleet as the market environment in Argentina has improved compared to last year, following a recovery of the demand after the end of the lockdowns. For Q3 2022, adjusted profit was $4.8 million compared to $4.3 million loss in the same period last year, mainly due to improved port segment performance and lower income tax on the Argentinian operations."
