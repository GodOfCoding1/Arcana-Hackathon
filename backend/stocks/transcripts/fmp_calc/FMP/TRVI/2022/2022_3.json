    "content": " Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of the company's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which the company filed with the SEC this afternoon. As expected, the full trial results for our CANAL trial in chronic cough and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, were reported in September and confirmed the positive interim results previously reported, showing a significant reduction in the frequency of cough from baseline, and were highly statistically significant on both the primary and several key secondary endpoints. So again, kind of sticking to what we've done, I would say that we're just working through inclusion/exclusion criteria, making sure the overall study design -- I mean the purpose of the next Phase II trial is really going to be around finding the minimally effective dose."
