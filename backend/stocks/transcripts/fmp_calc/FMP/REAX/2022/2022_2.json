    "content": " With 129% agent growth year-over-year in Q2 to just over 5,600 agents, we believe we are still continuing to see incredibly strong market share penetration despite current economic headwinds. It represents an incredible opportunity for Real to help develop a pipeline of high-producing agents in a quicker fashion, while receiving a 50% commission split on transactions completed during the 8-month program. Notably, our elite agents represent only 1.6% of the total agent base, which generated $22 million in commissions, which represents 19% of total commission revenues for the quarter."
