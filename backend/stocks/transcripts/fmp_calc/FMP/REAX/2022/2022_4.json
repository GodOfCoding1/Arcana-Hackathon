    "content": " Furthermore, our revenue churn, which we define as the dollar and amount generated by churned agents over the prior two quarters declined to 2.4% in Q4 from 2.5% in the prior quarter. For the full-year 2022, revenue increased to $382 million, a 214% increase compared to 2021. Fourth quarter revenue was $96.1 million a 90% year-over-year increase, while fourth quarter gross profit increased 100% year-over-year to $8.2 million. Our highest earning elite agents at the end of the quarter continue to represent the top 1% of our agent base, unchanged from the prior quarter, but are responsible for generating 12.7% of total commission revenue a slight drop from 13.6% in Q3. For these agents, the average commission revenue in Q4 was $30,300, which is higher than the overall agent productivity previously mentioned, but a 19% year-over-year decline and 14% quarter-over-quarter decline due to softer housing market conditions and seasonality. The large year-over-year increase reflects our expansion in the country during 2022, while the quarter-over-quarter drop reflects the larger slowdown in the Canadian residential market compared to the U.S. Our total operating cost for the quarter including revenue share was $15.2 million, which represents 15.8% of revenue. Our operating expense per transaction excluding revenue share, which is a core component of our agent incentives, increased narrowly by 6% year-over-year to $1,146."
