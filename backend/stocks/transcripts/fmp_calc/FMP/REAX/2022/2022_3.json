    "quarter": 3,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-11-11 17:36:05",
    "content": " As of September 30, 2022, we had over 6,700 agents on our platform, a 20% increase quarter-over-quarter and 126% year-over-year surge. However, our Canadian agents made up to 20% of commission revenue over the quarter, and Ontario represents the fastest-growing region across our footprint with transaction growth of 91% since Q2. Our highest earning elite agents at the end of the quarter represented only 1% of the total agent base, a slight quarter-over-quarter decline but generated $15 million in commissions, which represents 14% of total commission revenue for the quarter. Furthermore, our Canada business represented 20% of commission revenue generated by real agents in Q3, up 18% in Q2 as we continue to gain traction there. Meanwhile, our revenue churn, which we define as the revenue generated over the prior two quarters that is lost as a result of agents leaving the platform, during the quarter held relatively steady quarter-over-quarter, coming in at 2.5%. Based on a survey of a sample of our agents conducted at the end of the quarter, I'll note that, a very small percentage, 4% in our survey reported having less than one year of experience as real estate agents. Our operating expense per transaction, excluding revenue share, which is a core component of our agent incentives declined 10% quarter-over-quarter to 802 from 892 in Q2. Total operating cost declined 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to $12.9 million, highlighted by a 9.4% decline in G&A quarter-over-quarter, and including an 11.4% drop in the expense related to our revenue share program, which is our largest single operating expense."
