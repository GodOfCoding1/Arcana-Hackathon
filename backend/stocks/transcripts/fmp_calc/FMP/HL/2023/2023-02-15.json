    "content": " In just 4 months since the acquisition, Keno's reserves are 1/3 higher and we produce about 2.5 million silver ounces this year and in excess of 4 million next year. The direct result of these margins is the significant free cash flow generation we have seen over the past 3 years where our mines have generated more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow, including Casa Berardi's contribution of about $85 million from 2020 to 2022. Despite the lower realized prices, free cash flow generation from the 3 mines was approximately $110 million for the year, while our 2022 adjusted EBITDA declined $218 million due to the lower revenue and inflation-driven costs. Cash costs are expected to be lower at $0 to $0.25 per ounce, while the silver all-in sustaining cost is higher at $6 to $6.75 per ounce primarily due to equipment purchases and increased development as we target 2,600 tons per day. Lucky Friday reported a record year as the mine achieved operational milestones, including record tons processed and the highest silver production in the past 20 years. All-in sustaining cost for the year was $1,825 per gold ounce, exceeding our guidance due to lower metal production and higher production costs, driven by inflationary pressures. All-in sustaining costs from the mine are expected to be $1,975 to $2,050 per ounce, higher than 2022, primarily due to lower gold production and higher sustaining capital associated with the expansion of the tailings facility. We expect our silver production this year to increase 18% over '22 and continue to increase to as much as 20 million ounces in 2025, Keno with production between 2.5 million and 3 million ounces in Lucky Friday. At today's prices, we see about $150 million of free cash flow that we're going to invest in exploration, pay dividends, maintain our land positions and invest in Casa."
