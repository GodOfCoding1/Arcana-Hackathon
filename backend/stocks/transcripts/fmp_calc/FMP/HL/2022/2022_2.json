    "content": " But for Hecla, when we look at the quality of our silver mines, the strong production, low costs, the amount of capital we need to spend, the strength of our balance sheet, it's allowing us to focus on how we grow silver production. So, Lucky Friday, Keno Hill, and combined with the small increase at Greens Creek productivity really could increase our silver production to a sustainable 17 million to 20 million ounces of silver a year in the next few years. Quarter-over-quarter silver production increased by 38% to 1.2 million ounces, while ASIC decreased to $9.91 per silver ounce a reduction of 39% over the first quarter. We are reiterating production guidance of 4.3 million to 4.6 million ounces of silver, cost guidance is being increased to reflect the consumables associated with higher throughput, inflationary pressure on key inputs, and elevated contractor usage due to the tight labor market. First, in certain cases, we've made the decision to accelerate expenditures that we would have made in future periods, and an example of this is the additional drill contractor that we're bringing in at the Lucky Friday, that's going to allow us to have 18 months of data from creative production drilling for mine planning rather than what we have right now, which is 12 months."
