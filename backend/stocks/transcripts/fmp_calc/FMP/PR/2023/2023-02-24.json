    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say the biggest outperformance was probably in our Eddy County asset But during Q4, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen significant kind of outperformance across the Texas assets, the Lea County assets and Eddy County assets, which I think really does set us up for a really strong 2023. No, I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we think the 2023 plan does a lot, obviously, being able to continue to grow 10% on oil production from Q4 of 2022 to Q4 of 2023, given the kind of 9% beat in Q4 of 2022 sets us up really strong. I mean, effectively, our Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our Q4 of 2023 production on oil will be 9% higher than what we previously thought, which I think gives us a great starting point for 2024. And you can see the confidence we have in kind of accelerating the dropping of that seventh rig back to sixth kind of from somewhere around midyear to probably something closer to middle of second quarter, which I think is a testament to, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident we can still drill 150 wells with dropping to six rigs sooner and really the team is making a ton of progress. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally starting to see a little bit of relief on the tubular side, which obviously was the biggest line item to the overall AFE increase over the last kind of 18 months and are hopeful that kind of we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a little bit more deflation on the cost side kind of combined with the efficiencies that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to go get and then maybe we can continue to drive well costs down."
