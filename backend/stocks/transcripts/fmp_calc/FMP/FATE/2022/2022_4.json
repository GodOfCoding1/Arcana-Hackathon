    "content": " Taken together, we believe FT522 has the potential to improve safety and clinical benefit, reach patients earlier in care, including in the community setting, and seamlessly combined with standard of care regimens, including those that contain CD20 as well as CD38 targeted monoclonal antibody therapies. Despite the recent launch of two FDA approved BCMA targeted autologous CAR T-cell therapies, we believe an off-the-shelf multi-antigen targeted product candidate that is uniquely designed to synergize with CD38 targeted monoclonal antibody therapy may offer an attractive and differentiated value proposition. We are also particularly interested in expanding our clinical investigation of FT522 beyond oncology to autoimmunity, where recent publications have highlighted the potential of autologous CD19 targeting CAR T-cell therapy to induce drug-free remission in patients with certain severe autoimmune diseases. At the 2022 ASH Annual Meeting in December, we presented interim clinical data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of FT819, which showed a favorable safety profile and demonstrated objective responses in heavily pretreated patients, including in patients who were not eligible for or had previously failed autologous CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. Of the 8 patients with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma treated with a single dose of FT819 ranging from 90 million cells to 360 million cells, 2 patients were na\u00c3\u00afve to CAR T-cell therapy, one of whom achieved a complete response and 6 patients were previously treated with CAR T-cell therapy, 2 of whom achieved an objective response, including a complete response in a patient with DLBCL previously treated with 7 prior lines of therapy and who did not respond to autologous CD19 targeted CAR T-cell therapy. At the SITC 37th Annual Meeting held in November, we presented preclinical data of FT825, which highlighted the differentiated targeting profile of the product candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel HER2 targeted binding domain as well as the functional activity of the product candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel synthetic control, including to promote cell trafficking, redirect immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment, and induce T-cell activation. Your line is open. Your line is open. That said, I think was an off-the-shelf platform, the whole promise of an off-the-shelf platform is to be able to reach patients early on care in the community setting, where most myeloma patients are treated and ideally to deliver and plug into a standard monoclonal antibody regimen with CD38 without intense chemotherapy conditioning. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
