    "content": " Despite the higher variable costs and inflation, cash margins were $113 per short ton in the third quarter compared to $103 per short ton in the same period last year, demonstrating the leverage to higher met coal prices driving both profitability and free cash flow. Variable transportation and royalty costs were 47% of the cash cost of sales per short tons of $135 in the third quarter this year compared to only 39% in the same quarter last year, driven primarily by higher met coal pricing and sales volume."
