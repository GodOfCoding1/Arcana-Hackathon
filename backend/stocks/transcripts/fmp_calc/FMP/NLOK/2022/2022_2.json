    "content": " As Vincent mentioned earlier, our partner business again posted strong results in Q2, up 25% year-over-year, with continued strength in employee benefits, as well as growth from other distribution channels. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $695 million to $705 million, assuming stable currency rates quarter-over-quarter, which translates to 9% to 11% growth year-over-year. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP revenue growth of 9% to 10% year-over-year in constant currency and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.75, narrowing the range to the high end on both revenue and EPS versus what we shared with you back in May at our Analyst Day."
