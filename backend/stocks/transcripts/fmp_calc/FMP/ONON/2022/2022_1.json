    "content": " We're happy to report that ON had an excellent start into the year, and that we were able to further build on the momentum from last year, with CHF 236 million of net sales, a growth of 68% versus Q1 2021. As expected, as a result of the strategic decision to use air freight to ensure key product availability and to meet the continued strong demand despite the factory closures in Vietnam last year, our gross profit margin decreased year-over-year from 57.6% to 51.8% in Q1 2022. The higher net sales will allow additional growth-focused investments into the brand and the team, while increasing our adjusted EBITDA target for the full year to CHF 137 million, but also increasing our goal of an adjusted EBITDA margin to 13.2%. And I think, here, I also want to point out that, for example, in a market like Japan, where we had a little bit slower growth rates over the last two years, we're seeing that with the store opening that we had with additional investments in the brand. If you look at the marketing line with 12%, this is certainly where we would see additional investments if we overachieve and then be able to achieve higher net sales than where we currently guide  in strategic fields of the business via, as I said, especially on hiring the right talent, to maintain the growth and to secure the growth in the future has not slowed down and penalized by the airfreight."
