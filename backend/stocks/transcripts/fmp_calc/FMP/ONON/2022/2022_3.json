    "content": " We continue to win market share at existing retail partners, while selectively expanding our distribution to reach the right customers, which helped to drive an increase of net sales and wholesale of 55.6% versus a very strong prior year period. Overall, our wholesale door count in our own markets, that means excluding distributor markets, stands at 9,050 doors as of the end of Q3 versus 8,000 doors at the beginning of the year, reflecting a strong organic growth within existing stores through both existing and new products, while expanding distribution in a very controlled way. Q3 net sales in North America grew 57.1% to CHF 176.3 million, driven by the strong demand for our full product line across all retail partners and direct channels. Net sales growth in Europe accelerated compared to Q2, and we achieved CHF 116.5 million, 31.8% year-over-year growth despite the considerable FX headwinds from a strong Swiss franc versus the euro and British pound. Gross profit reached CHF 187.4 million in the third quarter compared to CHF 131.3 million in the previous year period, representing a gross margin of 57.1% versus 60.2% in Q3 '21. For 2022, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA target for the full year to CHF 148 million, reconfirming our goal of an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2% for the year, even at the elevated top line outlook and despite the additional challenges described beforehand. And if you look at the growth that we have seen in inventory versus last year, then majority of -- part of that growth is coming from growth in our warehouses, but that's more 60% growth."
