Finally, Rest of World net sales grew by 224.2% to CHF 8.8 million, reflecting the post-COVID recovery in many of our distributor markets as well as some earlier shipments of fall/winter products compared to Q2 last year. The higher net sales will allow additional growth-focused investments into the brand and the team while increasing our adjusted EBITDA target for the full year to CHF 145 million, reconfirming our goal of an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.2% for the year, even at a significantly elevated top line outlook. And we're having a bit of a shift from more online to off-line shopping, and that's probably going to continue in the second half of the year, but this is also what's reflected in how we're looking at D2C versus wholesale business in our Q2 numbers. I think one area that we're focusing very much and which will be important for us in the months and years to come as well is how can we provide very, very -- basically a very good brand environment to our consumers so that we can bring them back or keep them in the On environment. If you -- just to put then also the second half year growth into perspective for the -- with the first half year of growth and why is the outlook be below our year-to-date growth, one important element, of course, is the season shift that we had in the first quarter, so where basically the first quarter growth was not like-for-like compared to last year."
