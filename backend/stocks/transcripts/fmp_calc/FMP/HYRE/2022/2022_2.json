    "content": " Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $10.5 million, the highest in HyreCar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and building off the momentum from strong demand in March, this represents a 10% sequential increase in net revenue from the first quarter of 2022. Turning to financials, net revenue grew year-over-year 16% to reach $10.5 million in Q2 from $9.1 million in the same quarter last year. I think that if they were looking at Q3, Q4 of last year, even early in Q1, I don't know if it was prudent to go out and buy a $250 million in vehicle assets at the height of used car inventory pricing."
