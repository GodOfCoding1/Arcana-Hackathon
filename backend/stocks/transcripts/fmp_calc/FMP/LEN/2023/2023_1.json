    "content": " And in our first quarter -- and in our first quarter numbers, you can see our focus on these elements in our 14.2% debt-to-total capitalization rate, which is down 410 basis points from last year's 18.3%, and our $4.1 billion cash position, together with our 2% -- $2.6 billion undrawn revolver, which together provides excellent liquidity and flexibility. We fundamentally believe that our price to market strategy, reflects our balance sheet first focus where we can maintain starts and sales, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. In prior quarters, I had 3 categories: one, markets that are performing well; two, markets where we've adjusted pricing and incentives found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum, and three, markets that require additional pricing adjustments incentives and focus to regain our targeted absorption phase. I hope that I laid out well in our commentary that our strategic focus is taking into account the volatility, the unexpected and recognizing that we're going to stay very close to the market on a community-by-community basis and use our dynamic pricing model digital marketing platform to keep the production machine moving, and that will impact both sales prices and margins."
