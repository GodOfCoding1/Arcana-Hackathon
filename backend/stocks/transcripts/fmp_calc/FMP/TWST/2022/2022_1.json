This sequential growth of 10%, and up approximately 40% from $15.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Health care revenue in quarter one was $21 million, up from $16 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Even though we\u2019re operating in a pandemic where many academic labs were impacted globally, our academic revenue was $7.9 million versus $4.9 million in Q1 2021, reflecting our continued focus on growing the long tail, and agricultural revenue was $0.6 million versus $0.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. APAC had a terrific quarter one, with a revenue of $4 million, up from $1.8 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2021. U.S., which includes Americas, revenue was $22.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $17.3 million for the same period of fiscal 2021. Our quarter one operating expense, which includes R&D, SG&A and change in fair value of acquisitions was approximately $71 million. R&D for the quarter was $22.6 million, an increase from $19.4 million in quarter four, primarily due to increased biopharma spend associated with Revelar and the Abveris acquisition. Our SG&A costs in quarter one was $51.1 million as compared to $38.2 million in quarter four due to an increase in stock-based comp of approximately $9 million, change in fair value of contingent considerations and indemnity holdbacks for the quarter resulted in a gain of $2.8 million. Our net loss before tax was approximately $56 million as compared to $40.9 million for quarter four, primarily due to the aforementioned increases in operating expenses primarily stock-based compensation and costs associated with Revelar. In quarter one, we recorded a tax gain of $10 million associated with the Abveris transaction, which brings our loss after tax to approximately $46 million. NGS revenue is estimated to be in the range of $94 million to $96 million as we\u2019re projecting strong second half, based on our increased pipeline production scaling. Biopharma revenue, including the Abveris acquisition, is estimated to be in the range of approximately $25 million to $30 million as compared to previous guidance of $22 million to $27 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, if you just step back and look at the numbers, we billed about $19 million in the first quarter, and we're seeing significant step-up from that as we progress through quarter three and quarter four. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
