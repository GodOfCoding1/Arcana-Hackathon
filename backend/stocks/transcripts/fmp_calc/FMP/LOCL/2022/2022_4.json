    "content": " At our Montana facility, for example, we are currently seeing a 25% to 35% yield improvement compared to one year ago and that's translating to between 17.5 to 25 pounds of production per square greenhouse foot for our core SKUs. Following Phase 1-B completion, the site's greenhouse footprint will be established and ready to integrate the complementary stack zones that comprise Phase 1-C. We expect this work to be completed and online early in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a reminder, our Stack & Flow Technology is expected to add approximately 40% of incremental revenue generating capacity to the finished Georgia facility, which will be comprised of six acres of greenhouses and multiple climate, water and spectral controlled stack zones. Across our integrated business, we're seeing significant momentum for our product, and we're pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, Local Bounti and Peat's units per store sales velocities increased 16% and 20% on a dollar basis versus the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2022 net loss was $26.5 million as compared to a net loss of $28.3 million in the prior year period and includes $5.6 million in stock-based compensation, $4.5 million in interest expense, $3.6 million of depreciation and amortization, $2.9 million of business combination and integration costs, $0.4 million of restructuring and $0.4 million of costs related to inclement weather. In terms of our quarterly cadence, we expect that first quarter will look similar to our fourth quarter 2022 results as we work through the commissioning of the Georgia facility and improved production ahead of the opening of Phase 1-B in a couple of weeks, the addition of the four distribution centers in the second quarter and stack Phase 1-C completion in the fourth quarter."
