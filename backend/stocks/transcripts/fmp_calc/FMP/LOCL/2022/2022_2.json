    "content": " In parallel with the commencement of Phase 1-B, we also began construction of the Stack & Flow components to the facility, which will be integrated across both phases and is expected to add approximately 40% of incremental revenue generating capacity to the completed 14 greenhouses at the Georgia facility. We also continue to expect to achieve initial run rate revenue of at least 30 million at full production from our California and Georgia facilities, excluding the expected future positive impact from additional capacity due to implementing Stack & Flow across Pete's legacy facilities. And so having a facility just to call out, at one of our facilities, having a facility in Georgia doing salad is a huge value to retailers in the area because it -- not only does it help with the overall cost increases that they're going to see in traditional farming, but it also gives them the freshest product that they could get to market. Its one of the most important things to solve for, because if you could -- it's great to say, hey, we're doing X in Y location, but if you can't expand that nationally, you basically got an additional niche product, which isn't going to provide the value that we're looking here at Local Bounti."
