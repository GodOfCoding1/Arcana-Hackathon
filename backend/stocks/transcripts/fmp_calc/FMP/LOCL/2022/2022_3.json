    "content": " We achieved several milestones during the quarter, including shipping our first product out of our new Georgia facility, completing construction of our first Stack zone in Georgia and making important headway on our integration of Pete's to drive costs out of the business, and protect our margin from the persistent inflationary forces. Although, our Georgia facility opened in third quarter of 2022 and product is shipping out of the facility, third quarter operations were still under commissioning phase to prepare fulfilling Sam's Club demand and therefore, associated revenues were immaterial for the quarter. We also continue to expect to achieve initial run rate revenue of at least $30 million at full production from our California and Georgia Phase 1A facilities, excluding the expected future positive impact from additional capacity due to implementing Stack & Flow across Pete's legacy facilities. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. That's going to create opportunities for Local Bounti primarily because, remember, we have the ability to come in and bolt-on our Stack technology to existing operations that could get us geography or potentially talent, customers, et cetera, and we could get an extra 40% to 50% yield out of their existing facility. Please state your question."
