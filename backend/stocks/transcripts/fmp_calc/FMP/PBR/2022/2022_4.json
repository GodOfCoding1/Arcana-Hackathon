    "content": " So, starting with our ESG results and agenda, I would like to highlight what we had in terms of carbon intensity, not only in the Upstream segment in which we delivered results that were substantially below the acceptable limit that we set for 2022, but also in the downstream segment where we already see the results of our energy efficiency program called RefTOP on our refineries, reducing the energy intensity of our refineries, and of course, the overall carbon intensity of our operations. We also had -- we've also paid BRL72 billion in dividends to the controlling group to the federal government and the federal government related, and it is -- it's also important to remember that more than 60% of our cash flow generation returns to the Brazilian society, including taxes and also dividends that we paid to the Brazilian state as the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controlling shareholder. We've been phasing out of the 500 ppm diesel to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ppm diesel and over the course of 2022, it's also important to highlight that alongside with delivering record levels of 10 ppm diesel we were also able to maintain competitive prices aligned with the international market over the course of the year. I've already talked about decarbonization and the important reinjection project that we have, but it's also relevant to highlight that we had the first batch of renewable diesel being produced and the first test of a batch of bunker also with renewable content reinforcing our commitment to diversifying our sources and diversifying our products in terms of Scope 3 as well. And when we compare the Q4 with Q3, we have -- we had lower Brent prices in Q4, so that's going to show up also in terms of the financial results for the different segment. And another important aspect is that the results for quite in line with what was expected and being able to deliver solid and predictable and stable results is also one of our main targets, the main difference between what was expected in terms of results and what we delivered was basically related to non-cash expenses that are very difficult for the analyst community to forecast such as the write-offs of exploratory expenses, we've advanced with the development stage of the S\u00c3\u00a9pia area. We can see that, on Q4, we had important impacts of advancements for the new platforms that were contracted, but we also see a ramp-up in terms of investments for Q4, especially considering that when we compare 2023 and 2022, -- on 2023, we expect to invest $15 billion compared to $10 billion in 2022. This is basically the 60% of free cash flow formula and the distribution of the remaining part of the net income of 2022, the Board approved the suggestion of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Board of Directors approved the suggestion of the Executive Board, but also recommended to the shareholders the creation of a statutory reserve to retain BRL 0.50 per share -- BRL0.50 per share, and also if the shareholders do not agree with the suggestion that was made by the Board of Directors, they've suggested that this payment BRL0.50 per share occur by the end of 2023. Very proud of the results that we've achieved, once again, thanking and congratulating my peers at the Executive Board level for the important work that they've done over the course of the last that we finished together and also thanking all of the investors and shareholders for the trust that you gave us over the last two years."
