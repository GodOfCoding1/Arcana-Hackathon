    "content": " It's interesting to highlight not only the high utilization level of our refineries close to 90% in the quarter, 97% at the end of June, but also the level of integration of our operations and how well our entire supply chain has been working from the upstream segment to the downstream segment. So basically, looking at the solid financial results and the company's financial situation, we were able to approve the anticipated dividend of R$6.73 per share. So looking at the quarter results, as I mentioned before, $20 billion EBITDA for the power, better results, not only in the upstream and downstream segment, but also natural gas had lower volumes of LNG imports in the quarter that also supported our results for the second quarter of '22. So all of this translated in a net income of $11 million for the quarter, as I mentioned, the one-off is the negative impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian Real, period end, it impacted negatively net income, but it doesn't change the operational performance and the cash flow and economic situation of the company, so a very solid quarter, very solid operational results. We continue to negotiate and seek the best opportunities and contracts as well as managing contract terms and versions, avoiding permanent impacts of increased costs, even though it is natural that as the price of brent remains at high levels, new contracts will face some impact of inflation, although this impact tends to be partially diluted for the reason already mentioned. In terms of the framework that we use to decide on dividends, as I've mentioned before, of course, our main focus is to make sure that we're able to comply with the dividend policy over the next 12 to 24 months so to continue to be paying partly the 60% of free cash flow."
