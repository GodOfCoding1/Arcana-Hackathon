    "content": " When we look at our gross debt, of course, and we think about the upcoming future, the debt that is scheduled to mature in the next five years, the first quarter of 2014 was $58.1 billion that represents basically our entire debt now, not only the financial debt, but also the leases and the debt that is expected to mature in the next five years, is less than $17 billion now. The nature of the contracts, the supply distribution in terms of different supply sources in our portfolio, and also how the company's strategy for that segment is designed and I invite you to look at our website, those slides are in our website, and I think they're quite relevant to understand in more detail the Gas & Power segment. But also, we have approved extraordinary dividends given the company's substantial cash flow in the first quarter, of course, we focus on the pillars of our dividend policy, respecting the company's financial sustainability, but committing ourselves to distribute the maximum we can from our results and from our cash flow generation. Thank you, Jo\u00e3o Henrique. Thank you, Jo\u00e3o Henrique. Thank you, Jo\u00e3o Henrique."
