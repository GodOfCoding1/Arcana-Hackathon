    "content": " Revenue in our largest product family, OA pain management increased 20% to $23.7 million, due primarily to favorable year-over-year ordering patterns from J&J Mitek, which had greater quarterly volatility last year and to a lesser extent due to continued year-over-year international growth. By Product Family, our OA pain management revenue finished up 9% at $97.9 million at the high end of our most recent guidance expectations, primarily reflecting above normal international growth, due to recovery from the initial COVID impact, favorable distributor ordering patterns, as well as continued growing global commercial adoption of our combined portfolio of Cingal, Monovisc and Orthovisc."
