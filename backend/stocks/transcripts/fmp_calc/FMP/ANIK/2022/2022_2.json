    "content": " The X-Twist suture anchor offering, in combination with the recently launched Tactoset indication for augmenting suture anchor fixation, new shoulder implants and the rotator cuff repair system are all positioned to build strength and synergy in our joint preservation portfolio, providing additional growth opportunities in the over $1 billion shoulder market in the U.S. We also continue to be excited about our longer-term opportunities to bring our Hyalofast single-stage cartilage repair solution and Cingal for short- and long-term knee OA pain relief to the U.S. with the time line consistent with what we've stated previously."
