    "content": " I'm enthusiastic about the demand generated by a multi-tier direct-to-consumer marketing campaign thus far, which continues to be successful and driving patient engagement and filling surgeons pipelines for Lap-Band procedures evidenced by the 19% increase in sequential revenues achieved in the second quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect a positive trend in sales, as bariatric surgeons regain the ability to proceed with Lap-Band procedures, which were severely restricted in the early years due to the continued COVID-19 pandemic and as patients and providers continue to navigate the typical 6-month mandatory waiting period required by insurers for bariatric or weight loss procedures, including the anatomy sparing Lap-Band. Our confidence in this growth is strengthened by the success of our multi-tiered direct-to-consumer marketing campaign in helping practices work through patient backlogs, thereby allowing more new patients to pursue this process and further increasing the sales of the Lap-Band and our suite of weight loss in metabolic health solutions. Specifically, the rollout of reshapecare and its extension ReShape Marketplace, which includes advanced line of premium supplements allows ReShape to distinguish itself as an incredibly valuable e-commerce platform of health care provider recommended competitively priced weight loss and wellness products for bariatric surgery and medical weight loss patients that support nutrition exercise, sleep and stress. Through our national direct-to-consumer marketing campaign and other visibility programs, we will continue to maintain focus on marketing and the proven advantages of our FDA-approved insurance reimbursed anatomy sparing Lap-Band Program, along with the rest of our portfolio of physician-led weight loss solutions."
