    "content": " As a reminder, this DTC campaign utilizes strategically placed national television print, digital media, and public relations in order to market our Lap-Band program with available after care supported through ReShape Care, our reimbursable virtual health coaching platform that can also support weight loss objectives for people who are not surgery candidates. Our goal is to create and build consumer engagement leading to increased patient demand for our insurance reimbursed, next generation Lap-Band program and suite, a physician led weight loss support solutions, which also leads to a rise in bariatric surgeon engagement. It is important to mention again the four to six month mandatory weight period required by insurers for bariatric or weight loss procedures, including the Lap-Band as it means that after we transfer warm lead to the doctors from our DTC campaign, insurers will require a patient to go through several steps, which may include behavioral analysis, physical analysis, perhaps trying to medically manage weight loss program one more time to make sure that they can't lose weight and that they actually need surgery. Chief among these is ReShape Care, our proprietary digital therapeutic weight loss and wellness program, which is reimbursed by major insurance plans making it an effective and convenient virtual health coaching program to help our medically managed and bariatric surgery patients achieve and maintain their weight loss goals."
