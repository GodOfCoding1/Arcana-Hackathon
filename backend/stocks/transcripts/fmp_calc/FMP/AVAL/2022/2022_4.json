    "content": " In this context, the Central Bank's contractionary monetary policy has dictated continued hikes of its repo rate up to its current 12.75% after a 75 basis points hike during its January meeting, accumulating an 1100 basis points hike since September 2021. However, we do anticipate a softening of the labor market during 2023 given a softening and declaration of new jobs at the end of 2022, the slowdown in economic activity, the 16% increase in the minimum wage and anti-technical labor reform in the current contractionary monetary environment. Thank you, Luis Carlos. The year-end benchmark rate in Colombia increased 900 basis points during 2022 to 12%, but the average rate increased 528 basis points to 7.2% relative to 2021. In this context, net interest margin on loans of our banking segments contracted 41 basis points during the year to 5.29% in 2022. However, the higher funding cost of our non-financial activity resulted in an overall NIM on loans of 3.68% that contracted 67 basis points during the year. Net fee income decreased 6.9% year-on-year and increased 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, net fee income incorporates a substantial improvement in the banking and trust fees and a sharp decrease in the pension and severance fees. Thank you, Luis Carlos."
