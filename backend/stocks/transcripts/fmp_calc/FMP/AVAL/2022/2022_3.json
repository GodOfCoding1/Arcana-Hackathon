    "content": " In September, the national unemployment rate reached 10.7%, 120 basis points better than September 2021, while the average unemployment rate during the third quarter was 10.8% compared to 11% during the second quarter and 12.6% a year earlier. Considering the persistence of inflation, we don't rule out the possibility of one additional hike of 100 basis points in December, which would bring the year-end rate to 12%. Gross loans grew 5.1% for the quarter and 16.5% over the year, the highest figure since we adopted IFRS in 2015, and the second highest quarterly growth slightly below the 5.8% registered during the COVID-19 pandemic hit in first quarter 2020. During the quarter, Colombia Central Bank increased its reference rate by 250 basis points from 7.5% to 10% in an effort to anchor expectations amidst inflationary pressures. In addition, the higher funding cost of our non-financial activity resulted in an overall NIM on loans of 4.55% contracting 36 basis points during the quarter. Quarterly expenses increased 14.6% relative to third quarter of 2021, with personnel expenses increasing 8.8% and administrative expenses increasing 21% pressed increases in operating taxes, particularly the industry and commerce municipal taxes and by a depreciation of 14% of the quarterly average exchange rate that mainly affects IT-related OpEx in Colombia and overall expenses in MFG."
