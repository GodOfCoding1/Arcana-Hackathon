    "content": " If inflation behaves as expected, we believe that the tightening cycle will continue until the second semester, resulting in rate hikes of between 50 and 100 basis points before June 30, and additional rate hikes of 50 to 100 basis points in the third quarter, up to a possible 8% before year-end. The resulting pro forma attributable net income is similar to the net income achieved in some of the best quarters that we have posted in the past years, when we achieved our best historical results, including the 100% of BHI. Given that BHI represented approximately 30% of our book, the spin-off implied substantial variations of loans, fixed income investments, deposits, equity and other balance sheet items. To make the comparisons easier, the baseline quarters included in this report, our pro forma figures, where a 100% of BHI's contribution is attracted from our assets, liabilities and net income. In addition, performance ratios that use average balance sheet figures as denominators such as NIM, cost of risk and cost to assets, deduct 100% of BHI, including the beginning balance of first quarter 2022. Due to the fact that the spin-off was carried out at the end of March, we booked 100% of BHI's net income during the first quarter of this year, which we present on this page as net income from discontinued operations. Starting on second quarter 2022, we'll recognize 25% of BHI's net income under other income through the equity method."
