    "content": " Of significance because the spin-off of 35% of BHI was completed at the end of this year's first quarter, this quarter's result, the results do not include net income from discontinued operations. In fact, on a comparable basis, Aval delivered a quarter 7% higher and attributable net income than the first quarter of 2022 with notably better credit quality and cost of risk. Demand for consumer loans continued to be high resulting in a growth of 4.8% during the quarter, and 14.7% over 12 months. Personal loans, credit cards and more loans grew 7.2%, 5.8% and 5.1% over the quarter, taking annual growth to 19.8%, 12.9% and 14.6% respectively. Cost of risk net of recoveries was 1.4% including a 57 basis points quarterly improvement in commercial loans, 2.49% and a two basis points increase in retail to 2.6%. Our overall NIM fell 50 basis points to 3.64% during the quarter driven by a negative NIM on investments, a stable NIM and loans in our banking segments, combined with a higher funding cost of our non-financial activity resulted in a NIM on loans of 4.91% contracting 19 basis points during the quarter."
