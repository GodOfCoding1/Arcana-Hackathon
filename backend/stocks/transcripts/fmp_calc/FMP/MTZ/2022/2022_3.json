    "content": " In summary, third quarter performance was driven by approximately $600 million of year-over-year non-Oil and Gas segment revenue growth and with strong adjusted EBITDA margin rate performance of 10.2% of revenue. Third quarter Communications segment revenue was $889 million, a 33% increase when compared to the same period last year and 8% sequential growth when compared to the second quarter, reflecting expanded wireless/wireline services as telecommunications partners accelerate the deployment of spectrum and fiber for transformational 5G network enhancement. Based on normal year-end seasonality, we expect fourth quarter Communications segment revenue to moderate from third quarter levels and slightly exceed $800 million with adjusted EBITDA margin rate approximating last year's fourth quarter. Inclusive of IEA, we expect fourth quarter Clean Energy segment revenue to approach $1.1 billion at a mid-to-high single-digit adjusted EBITDA margin rate that exceeds last year's fourth quarter level, and this represents the highest Clean Energy segment quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin rate performance in over two years."
