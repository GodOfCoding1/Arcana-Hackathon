On today\u2019s call, I would like to highlight some key achievements that GBS team has made this quarter, specifically our clinical advancements, as well as development in the build-out of our high-tech manufacturing facility. As at March 31, 2022, the company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $10.7 million, compared to $12.5 million on June 30, 2021.
