    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 84% year-over-year to $33 million, with a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 38%, in line with our margin levels in the second half of 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 reached $33 million, increasing by 84% year-over-year. Although Q1 2022 has been marked by a challenging global macro environment due to the specific factors I have mentioned, our business continues to benefit from the diversity of our merchants across industry verticals, geographies, products and consumer behavior partners. Revenues also reached a new record high of $87 million during Q1 2022, having grown 117% year-over-year and 15% over the fourth quarter of 2021. As we have new merchants and scale existing ones, our revenue share from our top 10 merchants has continued to decrease from 62% in Q1 2021 to 52% in this quarter. During Q1 2022 of the 117% year-over-year revenue growth, 90% or 36 million came from existing merchants. Our revenue from existing merchants continues to grow from quarter to quarter, reaching $77 million in Q1 2022, more than doubling the $33 million that we achieved in the same period of last year. We were able to scale our gross profit to $44 million in Q1 2022, up 87% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Moving to adjusted EBITDA, it was $33 million for the first quarter of 2022, increasing by 84% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. As you saw, we have grown 117% year-over-year as far as our revenues are concerned, and I think it's coming from both existing and new merchants. So I think if you look at our gross margin, our gross profit has actually increased 87% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter to $44 million this quarter. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question."
