    "content": " Revenue in Africa and Asia in 2022 grew by 259% year-over-year, reaching $74 million in 2022 with significant opportunities ahead of us. In Q4, revenues increased by 5x year-over-year and grew 4% quarter-over-quarter reaching $26 million. We experienced higher than expected growth in Nigeria, which already accounts for 12% and 8% of our revenues in Q4 and full-year 2022, respectively. Moving on to Latin America, we continue to see solid growth across the region in 2022 with revenue growing by 54% year-over-year to $345 million in 2022. Going into more detail, in Q4 2022, revenue grew by 30% year-over-year and by 6% quarter-over-quarter to $93 million. In Q4 2022, we saw strong growth in our TPV, reaching $3.3 billion, up by 78% year-over-year and a strong 21% quarter-over-quarter. Following the trends seen in Q3, in Q4, we also experienced high growth in local-to-local TPV, increasing by 125% year-over-year and   quarter-over-quarter, due to the strong performance of some of our merchants. During 2022 of the 72% year-over-year revenue growth, 65% of $158 million came from existing merchants. For Q4 2022, of the 55% year-over-year revenue growth, 46% or $35 million came from existing merchants and 9% or $7 million came from new merchants. In Q4, our gross profit reached $55 million, up 42% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding these expenses that we believe are non-recurring in nature, net income would have been $116 million in 2022, an increase of 49% year-over-year and 27 million in Q4 2022.
