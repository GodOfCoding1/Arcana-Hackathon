The revenue from our top 10 merchants continues to increase quarter-after-quarter, reaching $59 million in Q3 2022 and accounting for 53% of our total revenue. Revenues also reached a new record, having grown 63% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter to $112 million in Q3 2022. During Q3 2022, of the 63% year-over-year revenue growth, 52% or $45 million came from existing merchants. Our revenues from existing merchants continue to grow quarter-after-quarter, reaching $104 million in Q3 2022, increasing by 83% compared to the $57 million that we achieved in the same period of last year. To summarize, our performance in this quarter shows the distinctive strengths of our business that we continue to build focused on long term profitable growth, combining: number one, from a financial standpoint, robust dollar amount growth on a TPV, revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA; with solid NRR for the nine months of 2022 at 166%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.

Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
