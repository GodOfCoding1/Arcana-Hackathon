    "content": " We're in the process of constructing a 2.2-mile pipeline that will connect our natural gas distribution system to a compressed natural gas vehicle fueling station owned and operated by clean energy fables as a cleaner burning fuel Utilization of CNG fueled fleet vehicles is helping customers achieve their sustainability goals, and this station also has the ability to receive renewable natural gas in U Leaf Florida not far from the office where we're sitting this morning. As shown on slide seven, as we traded all throughout the year, we continued to experience significant organic growth in our natural gas distribution businesses across both our Delmarva and Florida service territory. More specifically, some of the key margin drivers for the year included contributions from the acquisitions of Diversified Energy, Davenport, Fernando Gas and Theia meter station, continued infrastructure expansions and strong customer organic growth in our own natural gas distribution businesses. This includes higher adjusted growth margin from transmission expansion projects, natural gas distribution, organic growth, increased margins from our CNG, RNG and LNG services, higher performance from our propane and aspire operations along with additional income from our regulated infrastructure programs and recovery mechanisms. This growth was primarily driven by some of the same factors We've already talked about those being pipeline expansions in our transmission business, organic growth, and our natural gas distribution systems, incremental contributions from our various infrastructure programs, 4 months of interim rates associated with the Florida natural gas base rate proceeding and finally, contributions from the Escambia meter station acquisition."
