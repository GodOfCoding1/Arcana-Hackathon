    "content": " The diversified energy acquisition in North Carolina and Pennsylvania made a significant contribution in its first full quarter as part of the Chesapeake Utilities family, adding approximately $4 million of incremental adjusted gross margin. Some of the key gross margin drivers for the quarter included the contribution from Diversified Energy, which we acquired in December of 2021, that was really near the midpoint of December, continued pipeline expansions, as Jeff mentioned, strong customer growth in our natural gas distribution businesses as well. Operating income was slightly higher, up 6.3% and driven primarily by those pipeline expansions with Eastern Shore Natural Gas, Peninsular Pipeline, and also Aspire Energy Express in Ohio, our incremental contributions from our various infrastructure programs, organic growth in our natural gas distribution operations and contributions from the Escambia Meter Station acquisition."
