    "content": " The current Cambodian NHP supply constraints and the corresponding impact to our Safety Assessment business are expected to reduce our consolidated revenue growth forecast by approximately 200 basis points to 400 basis points this year, resulting in organic revenue growth guidance of 4.5% to 7.5% for the total company. In addition to NHP supply, several non-operating items are significantly affecting the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in 2023, including higher interest expense, a higher tax rate and the divestiture of our Avian Vaccine business, which was completed in December. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting stronger revenue growth in the first half of 2023, both due to the comparisons to last year when growth accelerated throughout the year as well as the gating of the NHP supply impact. Over the last five years, we have achieved compound annual growth of 16% for revenue and 17% for earnings per share, generating robust operating and free cash flow while continuing to make necessary investments to support the growth of our business.
