So I think the expectation is, is you'll have some blips there in the periods in which we launch into certain countries, specifically U.S. And then as more and more folks transition off of G6 to G7 and those increase, you're going to see those margins improve. Thanks a lot, everybody. This was a great quarter for us with growth, with excitement related to our product launches, expanding global access and performance on the bottom line as well in a time when the world is in a lot of chaos, we've done what we said we were going to do yet again. Thanks a lot, everybody."
