    "content": " With respect to the sales and the revenue numbers, G7 and DexCom ONE are still early enough in their launch life cycle that while they're additive, they're not what's driving a lot of the adoption, a lot of the growth that we've seen in European markets. It's going to take a little bit of time and the reason it's going to take a little bit of time is, as we get economies of scale on G6 which we have today across the existing user base as well as DexCom ONE as well as a lot of opportunity for new users on G7, we want to make sure we prioritize G7 and that form factor for those patients coming on to therapy on the G Series."
