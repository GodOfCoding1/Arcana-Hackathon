Do you think, should we think about that in line with historical 6% to 8% growth, organic growth for Cooper, or do you think you, can do better and currency Brian, I think I heard you talk about interest expense, but currency right now, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 3% headwind to sales $0.80 to EPS, any color on those too. The other one would be obviously China moving a little bit slower, so I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take it completely off the table, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably say $90, $95 is probably a better number that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll settle in on, on SightGlass I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get into too many specific details on it, but I will say that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re submitting that data and looking forward to talking to the FDA on that and believe we have a certainly a reasonable, good chance to get approval by a calendar you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
