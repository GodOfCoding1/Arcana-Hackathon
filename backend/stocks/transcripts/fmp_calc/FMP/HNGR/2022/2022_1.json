    "content": " During the first quarter, patient care revenue increased 12.3% year-over-year, driven by 6.9% same clinic revenue growth. Overall when we look at our results, we feel our first quarter patient care revenue growth of 12.3%, which constituted 84% of our revenues this quarter, establishes a solid foundation for the year as we return to normalcy. However, it\u2019s also important to point out that underlying same-clinic disallowances were 3.7% in the quarter and have generally been running about 35 basis points lower than total disallowances during the past 12 months as acquisitions join us with an inherently higher rate of disallowed revenue prior to their integration. Additionally, in looking at the patient care segment 6.9% same clinic rate of growth, if you adjust put a swing in disallowances, the underlying same clinic growth rate during the first quarter was 7.9%. In reviewing these results, it\u2019s important to note that due to the seasonality of our business, the unique nature of the events that affected operations in the first quarter and an inherently fixed cost structure, Hanger\u2019s first quarter earnings have always been highly volatile and are not a useful indication of the company\u2019s performance trends for the full year. In summarizing the company\u2019s total earnings performance during the quarter, in recent years Hanger\u2019s first quarter adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of the total year has ranged from 5% to 10% of full-year results."
