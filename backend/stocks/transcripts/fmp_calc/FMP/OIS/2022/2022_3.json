    "content": " During the third quarter of 2022, the company continued to show improvement as the industry expands activity to support growing demand following the harsh economic impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic generating revenues of 189 million and EBITDA of 22 million, representing sequential increases of 4% and 29% respectively. We were net income positive for the quarter with sequentially improved results from each of our business segments driven by strong activity levels in the United States, which led to increased demand for our short cycle products and services. During the third quarter of 2022, the segment recorded a litigation settlement gain of 6.1 million partially offset by low margin product sales during the quarter, where we incurred high material and freight costs given the timing of project deliverables, which we view as an isolated occurrence. Third quarter 2022 bookings totaled $115 million, yielding a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x, while our year-to-date 2022 book-to-bill ratio is one time. In our wellsite services segment, we generated revenues of $61 million operating income of 2.4 million and segment EBITDA of $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. In our downhole technology segment, we reported revenues of $33 million and segment EBITDA of 4.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to revenues of 31 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of 2.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2022."
