    "content": " And my question is since like locally here, there are houses, well over $500,000 and with the interest rates now going up, most of the companies have had pretty good heads up with Powell telegraphing, the fed's move well in advance, but the housing market, which was booming, now it's subsiding to a point where the builders are reducing locks by some $50,000 houses by $50,000. The now this is changing and one of the things we're doing with the free camera scanning is we would be able to service the Android market, which is much bigger and by starting people at a lower price point, we feel we'll be able to support more of the world with these options going forward."
