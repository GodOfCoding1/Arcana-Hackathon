    "content": " Such statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward-looking statements because of a number of factors including but not limited to, the risk that manufacturer of Sockets products may be delayed or not rolled out as predicted due to technological market or financial factors, including the availability of product components and necessary working capital. In Q3, our revenue decreased to 41% to $3.7 million, compared to $6.3 million in the prior year quarter, and the decrease is 38% sequentially compared to $6.1 million in Q2 2022. The weaker end user demand combined with the reduction of inventory in our distribution channel affected our reported revenue, even though the sales from our distribution partners to end users are $4.8 million, compared to our reported revenue of $3.7 million. Q3 operating expenses are $2.6 million, increased to 5% over the prior year quarter, but decreased to 9% sequentially over the preceding quarter."
