    "content": " The risk that market acceptance and sales opportunities may not happen as anticipated, the risk that Socket's application partners and current distribution channels may choose not to distribute the products, or may not be successful doing so, the risk of that acceptance of Socket's products in vertical application markets may not happen as anticipated, as well as other risks described in Socket's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Q1, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash used in operating activities of $1.3 million, which was primarily from increased accounts receivable driven by higher shipment levels and the security deposit for our new office building's lease agreement. I think it's very commendable that you guys have $5.4 million cash balance, but my question is, what's the purpose of yielding up precious money in this day and age buying back your stock for number 1, to increase the  is this. From my other observation of buying back stock at this point in time is not -- I don't see the purpose, other than if you can look at maybe a preferred, like one preferred to equal 100 shares, and you can do the same ratio versus what shares you're looking to buy."
