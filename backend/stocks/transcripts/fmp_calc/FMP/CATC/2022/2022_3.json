    "content": " Core deposits decreased by 2% from the second quarter as a result of clients using funds for real estate purchase, business investment opportunities combined with market competition and certainly search for yield. While provision for loan loss expense and funding and cost increased during the quarter, non-interest expenses remained controlled and core profitability remained good with return on average assets of 1.15% and return on tangible common equity of 14.94% both on an operating basis. Despite lower deposit growth than previously anticipated, we have the liquidity and flexibility to manage in this environment given expected securities cash flows, our core deposit beta expectations, borrowing capacity and the positive impact of Northmark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash position, which has already been used to reduce outstanding borrowings in the fourth quarter. Moving to capital, as you can see within this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release, despite continued increases in market rates, tangible common \u00e2\u0080\u0093 excuse me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tangible book value per share grew during the quarter and while the tangible common equity ratio declined slightly during the quarter, we expect TCE to be approximately 8% by year end inclusive of the impact of Northmark. Northmark brings an engaged team, wonderful clients, logical expansion markets and a healthy balance sheet with approximately $370 million in loans and $373 million in deposits prior to the finalization of the accounting for mark-to-market."
