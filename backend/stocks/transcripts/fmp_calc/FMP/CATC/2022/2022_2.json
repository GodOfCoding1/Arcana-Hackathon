    "content": " As expected, loan growth continued during the second quarter in both commercial and residential lending with 3% linked-quarter growth. The adjusted net interest margin expanded by 14 basis points to 2.81% during the second quarter, reflective of our asset sensitive position and strong core deposit base. While wealth revenue negatively affected total fee revenue during the quarter, expenses remain controlled and core profitability remain good with return on average assets of 1.07% and a return on tangible common equity at 14.07% on an operating basis. As such, we have recasted expectations for the full-year and the growth range is now expected to be 5% to 7% of total deposits from 8% to 10% previously. If fed funds were to increase to 3.60% by year-end, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of 2.80% to 2.95% for the full-year of 2022, better than the prior quarter net interest margin guidance of 2.7% to 2.85%. That seems like that could even still end up being a bit light on a core basis given that if the pull through rates kind of stay the same going to the third quarter unless even if commercial ends up being flat in the fourth quarter and resi ends up being down, it still seems like a fairly easy bogey to get to that 8% to 10% range."
