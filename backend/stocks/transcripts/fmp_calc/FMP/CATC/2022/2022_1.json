    "content": " The level of our current pipelines, combined with robust market activity, give us comfort with the previously anticipated growth range of 6% to 8% for the full year and we may exceed that range. We also continue to see solid deposit opportunities as evidenced by the core deposit growth during the first quarter, again, giving us comfort with the full year growth range of 8% to 10% previously announced. If there were six more 25 basis point increases moving fed funds to 2% by year-end, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of 2.70% to 2.85% for the full year of 2022, better than the prior NIM guidance of 2.5% to 2.6%. Noninterest income growth will be less than the initial estimates of 7% to 9% for the full year, primarily due to volatility within the equity markets and corresponding Wealth Management revenue, and lower sales of conforming mortgages. Core deposits grew 32%, that's not the kind of growth we're expecting this year."
