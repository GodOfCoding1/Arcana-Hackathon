    "content": " With respect to VK2809, our lead drug candidate for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis, we recently announced completion of enrollment in our Phase IIb VOYAGE trial, and we expect to announce top line data from this study in the second quarter of 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Viking reported a net loss of $19.6 million or $0.26 per share compared to a net loss of $12.4 million or $0.16 per share in the corresponding period in 2021. The increase in net loss and net loss per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to the increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses noted previously compared to the same period of 2021."
