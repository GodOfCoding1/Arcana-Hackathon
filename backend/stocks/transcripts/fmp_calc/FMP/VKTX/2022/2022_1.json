    "content": " I\u2019d like to first provide an update on our lead clinical program VK2809, which is currently being evaluated in our Phase 2b VOYAGE study in patients with NASH and fibrosis. Anything, that you're expecting to look out for at EASL this year, either from Viking or any of your competitors that we should be watching for, and then separately, can you just comment on your expectations for Madrigal\u2019s Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial with results coming up later this year and how you're thinking about any potential read across to VK2809 and then I had a follow up if I could. But just like with VK2809, in NASH it would probably be better to have a partner involved in certainly in the commercialization portion of the compounds progression, but also in the Phase 3, not to say we couldn\u2019t do it, but I think that would be better to have a larger company involved. I think as long as we\u2019re above the 30% threshold and most of the patients are characterized as responders, which is what we clearly saw in the Phase 2a study we should be in good shape that\u2019s been shown repeatedly to increase the probability of NASH resolution and improvement in fibrosis."
