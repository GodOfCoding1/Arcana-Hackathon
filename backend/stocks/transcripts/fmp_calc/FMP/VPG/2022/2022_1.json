    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, we reported sales of $87.7 million, which was 24.2% higher than a year ago. Beginning with our Sensors segment, which is comprised of our Advanced Sensors products and our precision resistors, first quarter revenue of $37.7 million grew 18.7% from a year ago and was 10.5% higher sequentially. The first quarter adjusted gross margin improved to 38.6% as compared to 34.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting higher revenue and favorable product mix, which was partially offset by wage increases. Revenue in the first quarter of $17.1 million declined 27.9% sequentially, reflecting primarily lower sales due to the steel market. In the first quarter of 2022, we achieved revenues of $87.7 million, gross profit of $35.3 million or 40.2% of sales, operating income of $8.3 million or 9.5% of revenues and diluted net earnings per share of $0.46. Foreign exchange for the first quarter of 2022 negatively impacted revenues by $1.5 million compared to a year ago and negatively impacted revenues by $500,000 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, first quarter gross margin was 41% as compared to 40.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and exclude $400,000 of acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, $200,000 of facility startup costs for Advanced Sensors and $138,000 of COVID-19 related costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $26.7 million or 30.4% of revenues as compared to $22.2 million with 31.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2021."
