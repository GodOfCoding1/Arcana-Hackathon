    "content": " Total revenue in the second quarter was $42.5 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 6.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by continued strength in the company's health care and pharma, retail, travel and software and Web sites verticals. Adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP metric that removes traffic acquisition-related platform operations cost in the second quarter was $28.3 million or 66.7% of revenue compared to 66.9% in the same period of the prior year. Moving down the income statement to operating expense; second quarter operating expenses were $41.2 million, an increase of $3.9 million or 10.3% versus the second quarter of 2021, platform operations expenses for Q2 2022 were up $2.6 million or 14.2%. Sales and marketing expenses for Q2 2020 were up approximately $2.7 million or 31.6% primarily due to an increase in equity-based compensation allocated to sales and marketing, an increase in employee expenses related to hiring for the sales and customer support teams and an increase in travel-related expenses, as sales personnel continue to resume more traditional business travel. As a machine learning company, and a technology company, one of the ways that we can make an impact is to bring in better and bigger data that is the source, bring in the real source data, the most accurate data that you can find, whether it's in our health care space, insurance claims data or in other verticals, there are different data sets, but access those data sets and then we can create seed audiences in our models that allow us to go find ad impressions that have attributes that look like the seed audience that is converting or that is within a given audience segment, so to speak."
