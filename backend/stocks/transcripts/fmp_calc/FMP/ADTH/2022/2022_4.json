    "content": " In Q4, our revenue also surpassed our expectations, reaching $51.8 million, a decline of 5.8% compared to the same period last year due to the impact of macroeconomic conditions and the contraction in advertising budgets across several industries, particularly in our retail and financial services verticals. Nevertheless, we saw a 12% year-over-year growth in active customers and impressive growth rates in our areas of investment, including 46% growth in CTV, strong performance in direct access and positive momentum in our health vertical. The increase in adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales to 89.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus 87.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven by higher public company costs, particularly in insurance and continued investment in future growth opportunities, such as our health care platform. Adjusted gross profit for the full year was $109.8 million or 66.1% of revenue, which was above the high end of the expected range and flat with full year 2021, which was also a 66.1% margin. So, I think we've had really strong consistent loyalty from long-tenured customers, customers that have been with us for 3 years or more, 70% of our revenue in '22 came from them as Patrick mentioned, we're also landing and expanding. And therefore, you can go in a user can go into direct access and create an audience, a predictive audience either for health or some other vertical activated within our platform, not have to pay a third party for an outdated and deficient ID-based audience, but you can build a statistical audience from our data sets or from the customer data that's right in our platform."
