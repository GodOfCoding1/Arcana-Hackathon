    "content": " We have not been -- as we've expanded throughout the world, and there's been more and more customer interest in our systems, just from a coverage perspective and a resources perspective, this year, obviously as you guys have seen, like we've been able to hit in previous years like 38,000, 39,000 pull-through. I think two, we're going to really -- especially internationally, but just around the world, continue to really think thoughtfully about partnering distribution wise to increase our coverage, right, to touch the customers and really hear the customers on a more regular basis. I mean so if you think about where that came from, a couple of those units were really exciting partnerships that we're dealing with people for more collaborative partnerships, which I would call testing the IsoSpark and our systems in various new places and with new applications that are I think just exciting and I can't say much about it because it's confidential. A lot of times, that cross pollinates, right, with other aspects of the pharma that aren't as virtual in nature, that do run their own labs, right, and that do want instrumentation that's relatively easy to use, but also delivers this differentiated, large signature immune data from single-cells and now from bulk. We're not -- the phased and focused approach is we already know a bunch of customers that have IsoSpark systems that with the robustness, with vast improvement in throughput and all these things are just like; we have a set, a universe in Q1 where we know they're going to want to use CodePlex Q. And I think the phase of push for us is as we work with them, as we demo our CodePlex Q, as they use that system, we're going to be focused on people that honestly like large signature data, but they don't have an easy-to-use, automated pipette and go system, and that's hurting their sort of lab operations."
