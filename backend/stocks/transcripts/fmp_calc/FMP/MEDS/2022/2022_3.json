Consolidated revenues for the third quarter of 2022 decreased 6% to $2.4 million, compared to revenue of $2.6 million in the same quarter last year. The revenues generated by the TRxADE platform increased 6% in the third quarter of 2022, as compared to the same quarter in 2021. Although TRxADE Prime experienced an 11% decline in revenue for the third quarter of 2022, compared to the same quarter in 2021, there were several other important metrics that we work to improve. This result of this focus was improved gross margin to a positive 3% compared to a negative 6% for the comparable third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The revenue decrease for Community Specialty Pharmacy in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the same quarter in 2021, is partially driven by decreased sales in the last week of September, due to Hurricane Ian. Gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 increased to $1.4 million or 58% of revenue, as compared to $1.3 million and 50% of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. The expense decrease for these comparable periods, is partially due to a $630,000 bad debt expense recorded in the third quarter of 2021, increasing operating expenses for 2021, as compared to 2022. Net loss in the third quarter of 2022 was negative $0.5 million or negative $0.06 per basic and diluted share outstanding, compared to a negative $1.3 million or negative $0.16 per basic and diluted share outstanding for the same quarter in 2021.
