    "content": " This market share number illustrates three key takeaways for TYRVAYA: first, since launch, TYRVAYA has become a key therapeutic option for ECPs treating dry eye disease patients; second, an early read on the potential for TYRVAYA's commercial market share with continued ECP adoption; and third, this market share has been achieved prior to launching a full-scale direct-to-consumer marketing campaign, which has been shown across the industry to stimulate prescriptions and impact market share. For Q2 '22, TYRVAYA achieved net product revenues of approximately $4.7 million, demonstrating strong quarterly performance, increasing 74% versus Q1 '22 following TYRVAYA's U.S. commercial launch in November 2021. Other sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.5 million for Q2 '22 compared to the same period in 2021, in connection with advertising, samples, trade shows, educational programs, patient services, payer access and other marketing efforts related to the commercialization of TYRVAYA. I think from the Medicare Part D side, obviously, one of the things that's really an important attribute of TYRVAYA is really think that this is a product that is really foundational therapy for patients with dry eye disease."
