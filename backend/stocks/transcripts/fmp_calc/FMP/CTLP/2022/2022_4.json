    "content": " Our revenue during the quarter was $58 million, up 18% over last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, we reported a 23% increase in revenue to $205 million, also a new company record in delivering on the initial guidance we provided last September despite a slowdown in transactions during the winter months due to the resurgence in COVID-19. Q4 FY 2022 revenue was $58 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year, simply driven by subscription and transaction fees of $44.9 million and equipment sales of $13.1 million. Subscription and transaction revenue margin was 39.5%, flat year-over-year, while equipment revenue margin was negative 4.6% in Q4 2022 compared to a negative 2.3% in the prior year. Recall that in fourth quarter of 2021, reported OpEx benefited from a one-time sales tax pro reduction of $2.9 million due to the state law change. Based on what we see today, we expect the following: total revenue to be between $225 million and $235 million representing growth of 10% to 15%."
