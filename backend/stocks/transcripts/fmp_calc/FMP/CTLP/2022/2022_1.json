Micro markets are expected to grow somewhere between 15% and 30% this calendar year, and growth is expected to accelerate into calendar 2022 according to Automatic Merchandiser\u2019s 2021 state of the industry report. Q1 FY2022 revenue was $45.8 million, a 24% increase year-over-year, driven by record transaction and subscription fees of $26.4 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Equipment revenue for the first quarter was $5.2 million, a 37% year-over-year increase but down sequentially following a record high amount in Q4 FY2021. Subscription and transaction revenue margin was 35.9%, reflecting a higher mix of transaction revenue versus the prior year quarter\u2019s gross margin of 41.6%. Total operating expenses in the first quarter totaled $16 million compared to $17.9 million in Q1 FY2021, a 10% decrease over the prior year, driven by lower G&A expenses.
