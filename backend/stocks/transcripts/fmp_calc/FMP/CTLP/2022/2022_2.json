    "content": " A few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with HIVERY, which will provide customers with artificial intelligence power merchandising capability, powerful new product recommendations, targeted space to sales optimization, are all enabled using HIVERY\u2019s proprietary algorithms to boost the top-line of Cantaloupe\u2019s customers and improve operational efficiencies. During the second quarter, we continued our trend of strong year-over-year revenue growth attributable to increases in transaction volumes, as well as demand for devices as industry fully migrates to 4G technology. Q2 FY 2022 revenue was $51.1 million, a 33% increase year-over-year, driven by subscription and transaction fees of $41.2 million, and equipment sales of $9.9 million. The 24% increase in subscription and transaction fees year-over-year is primarily driven by approximately 31% increase in total dollar volumes for Q2 2022 compared to last year, and we\u2019re currently exceeding pre-pandemic levels of processing volumes. Equipment revenue for the second quarter increased 95% year-over-year, as many customers held off on delivery of 4G devices \u2013 with 4G upgrade devices until closer to the discontinuation of the 3G network support starting in 2022. And what it gives us structure for us to add potential operators who need software, or want to resell our software, and think of it is, in many cases, we\u2019ll be leveraging our current U.S. partners, whether that\u2019s  , and then local providers who can provide payment capability that we can partner with there may be some situations where we white label things basically to find a way to enter into the market, because we think once we\u2019re in a market we can expand it."
