    "content": " On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we reported an adjusted operating loss of $1.6 million, an improvement of $700,000 or 30.6% compared to $2.4 million for the same period last year. Total adjusted operating expense for the quarter was $43.9 million, reflecting an improvement of $1.4 million from last year, primarily related to the reduction of $1.5 million in compensation and benefit expense. And the Medium Giant employees that service that revenue line, we would really need to take that out separately versus \u2013 and there is probably, I want to say, 170 to 180 people within Medium Giant versus looking at the rest of the employee base and looking at the print advertising revenue versus the circulation revenue, but that\u2019s something I can look at. And you were happy to be able to receive or may become happy to receive a 4.5% rate of return on the $22 million that was owed to you from \u2013 for the headquarter sale, but you are paying 9.5% or more at the current share price out to your shareholders, which I am appreciative of, but there is a quicker way to get a higher return than 4.5% on your money."
