    "content": " As a reminder, in the third quarter last year, net income included a tax benefit of $2.4 million, primarily related to the release of a noncash uncertain tax reserve whereby the federal statute of limitations had lapsed. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we reported an adjusted operating loss of $1.6 million, $400,000 greater than the $1.2 million loss for the same period last year. Total adjusted operating expense for the third quarter was $44.8 million, an improvement of $1.4 million from last year, primarily related to savings in compensation and benefit expense and distribution, offset by an increase in newsprint expense."
