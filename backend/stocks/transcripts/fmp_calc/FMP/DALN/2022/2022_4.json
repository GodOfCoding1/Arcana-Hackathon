    "content": " In Q4 of last year, we reported net income of $2.1 million and an operating loss of $700,000. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, we reported an adjusted operating loss of $1 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to adjusted operating income of $300,000 reported for the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, total adjusted operating expense for the quarter was $40.1 million, an improvement of $200,000 when compared to the same period last year, driven by expense savings of $1.1 million in distribution expense due to reduced TMC and out of market preprint revenue and $600,000 in services, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in employee compensation and benefit expense. On a non-GAAP basis for the year, we reported an adjusted operating loss of $5.3 million, a $1.5 million greater loss when compared to an adjusted operating loss of $3.8 million reported for the same time last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to reductions of $2.7 million or 5.6% in print advertising revenue and $900,000 or 3.6% in digital advertising and marketing services revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, total adjusted operating expense for the year was $155.9 million, an improvement of $2.3 million or 1.4% when compared to $158.2 million of adjusted operating expense last year. The improvement is primarily due to expense savings of $2.7 million in distribution, $1 million in employee compensation and benefits partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in newsprint expense."
