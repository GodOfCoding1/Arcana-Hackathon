    "content": "  Sunnova had its best quarter for sales in company history in the second quarter, creating a significant backlog of customers, which we expect to be placed in-service by the end of the year; the increasing traction with upselling energy services to existing customers; the earnings stability our long-term contracted cash flows generate that allow us to meet and in some cases exceed expectations for adjusted EBITDA and the interest payments we collect on solar loans, even when customer additions fall below expectations; and the robust demand we are seeing for our essential energy services even in the face of waning consumer confidence as homeowners seek an offset to rapidly rising energy costs.
