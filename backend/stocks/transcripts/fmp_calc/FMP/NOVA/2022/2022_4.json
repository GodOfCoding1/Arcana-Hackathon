    "content": " We have seen the strong demand for our energy services carry into the new year as customer originations last month were approximately 125% higher than in January of last year, a trend that continues. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average contract life remaining on our customer contracts equaled 22.3 years and expected cash inflows from those customers over the next 12-months increased to half a billion dollars, an increase of 30% from December 31, 2021. Given the strong demand we continue to see for our energy services, accompanied by our robust backlog and the insight we have into our future financial results from retaining our long-term contracted cash flows, we can confidently reaffirm our full-year 2023 guidance as well as our Triple-Double Triple Plan. So they are pretty profitable customers and we still see a tremendous amount of demand and growth and we will continue to build out our software capability and our logistics capability both in supply chain and the actual our technicians that go out there and get things fixed for customers get them back online, where they can have a better energy service at a better price. We have got either in service customers at this point, which are well ahead of the quarter plan, so far, and I expect that trend to continue or in the backlog well over 50% of the customers that we expect in our guidance at our midpoint already for this year. So we have a lot of faith in that burdened unlevered return continuing to push up and to grow and certainly we expect that to be - we would love to see that get into its awkward adolescence and teenage years if we possibly could, but we are seeing really a lot strength in the fully burdened unlevered return and that more so than the stabilization of the capital markets is where we are seeing that opportunity for the spread."
