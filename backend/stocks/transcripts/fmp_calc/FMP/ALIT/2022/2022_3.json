    "content": " Given this performance, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth projection of 6% to 7% and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $650 million to $662 million, putting us on track to achieve year 2 of our 3-year plan. We signed $208 million in BPaaS bookings, which puts our first 9 months total at $564 million, more than 80% of the way to our full year goal of $680 million to $700 million. Finally, we recognized $151 million in BPaaS revenue, up 55.7% from last year, with BPaaS now accounting for over 20% of revenue, up from 14% a year earlier. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter total revenue increased 8.7% to $750 million, and total revenue, excluding our legacy hosted business, increased 8.8% to $740 million. On a total contract basis, BPaaS bookings for the third quarter were $208 million, and for the first 9 months of the year totaled $564 million, which is well on track for our $680 million to $700 million target for 2022. Third quarter revenue increased by 2.2% to $95 million, driven by a 3.3% growth in project revenue and recurring revenue was unchanged. In the third quarter, we were able to recognize $5 million in project revenue across Employer Solutions and Professional Services earlier than anticipated, which provides us with more certainty for the full year revenue outlook."
