    "content": " Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. And before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Overall, the operating environment in the first quarter was much like the fourth quarter of 2021, but our team\u2019s improved their ability to navigate through this challenging environment. Q1 gross margin expanded 70 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 60 basis points versus last year at 45.6% driven by favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable price cost, despite rising inflation. This result is driven by higher earnings being more than offset by increases in working capital due to the volume impact on receivables, as well as additional inventory we\u2019ve strategically added to help mitigate some of the longer lead times we are experiencing. We levered well on the volume increase had strong price capture, and our team\u2019s drove operational productivity to offset the profit headwinds we experienced from inflation. With that, I\u2019ll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, driven by strong volume leverage and operational productivity, which includes benefits from our energy and Italy site consolidation projects, non-repeat of prior inventory reserve adjustments, and some offset from resource investments. Life sciences continues to experience strong demand due to an overall awarded focused around healthcare in areas such as point-of-care and patient diagnostics, as well as increased next-gen sequencing demand as the market for cell-based therapies expands and applications like cancer research. I\u2019m on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the second quarter of 2022, we\u2019re projecting organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and operating margin between 23% and 23.5%. Given our strong first quarter performance, but potential risk and uncertainty on the back half of the year, we are raising the low-end and holding the high-end of organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance. At this time, we see potential risks that further revenue acceleration may be tempered by the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain effects related to the China\u2019s Zero-COVID policy. And at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning, everyone. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot going on the environment here. It\u2019s still pretty healthy underneath the hood for you, I know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks maybe some hesitancy on the larger project side of things. Look, it\u2019s holding pretty steady for us all over the place. I continue to see that, honestly, it\u2019s just a question of resource availability, ability to focus on doing the work, either in the current context or even projecting across the future as people consider all the things that that are on the table there that could disrupt that. That being said, we\u2019ve seen some projects here and there, and places like energy, and certainly a few in the chemical space, some short-term stuff in water that indicates, people are trying to get at capacity just like we are and throughput, so that continues to add to the mix. So I \u2013 very, very strong, overall steady, and that\u2019s one thing that makes it pretty easy to navigate. And then, I know, we\u2019ll dive into price cost along the way. But, of course, we\u2019ve done our best there to keep our head above water. That\u2019s a good mix for us overall, and you see it reflected in performance. Please proceed with your question. Just a couple of questions on the guidance to start with, it looks like pretty much your guidance for revenue for the rest of the year, even at the high end relative to the first quarter, the quarterly run rate is up only by about as much as the Nexsight acquisition adds. As we look at, obviously, the team\u2019s ability to increase their output directions we\u2019re taking internally has improved with some of the external events that have happened recently in the unknown longer-term implications just can\u2019t count on significant ramp from our current volumes that we\u2019re at now. Obviously, if things unwind and resolve there\u2019s upside opportunity in the back half, definitely based upon the strong backlog that you\u2019ve highlighted. You guys have certainly stepped up the pace of acquisitions, and how aggressive you\u2019ve been there. Does this change your calculus in how you are thinking about going up there acquisitions in terms of, how you\u2019re de-risking your deal models, risk premiums, that you\u2019re putting on things. Yeah, I\u2019d say, I mean, not a lot in the short-term, again, it come back to kind of the nature of the assets that we\u2019re looking at here. They\u2019re very representative of kind of classic IDEX businesses, high mission critical solutions, risk adverse end markets, I mean, they\u2019re not the kind of businesses that Bob and we\u2019ve a lot in the short-term. So not to say, we\u2019re discounting any of those things, but certainly \u2013 particularly in the short-term, it doesn\u2019t really change the view of what we think is favorable for the long-term health of the company. No, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s often a lagging phenomenon. And again, this \u2013 we\u2019re in very high quality waters, with generally long histories that anybody would refer to, and just degrees of health in the future, all positive. Please proceed with your question. When we see record orders, record sales, record backlog, and upside in organic, it\u2019s not sure that you did miss any revenues, because of supply chain. Again, the team\u2019s ability to work through some of the operational output, and then just slight improvements in some of the supply chain areas, a lot less than, I think, we quoted around 3% in the fourth quarter, much lower number kind of a couple of basis points type of framework. And on the cascade on that shows the growth investments in discretionary, I\u2019m always interested in knowing some of the specifics inside there, because, obviously, you could cut-back on growth investments anytime and dress up quarterly earnings, but that\u2019s not what you all do. Yeah, Deane, we\u2019re committed to invest, making these investments and outside of what happens in the short-term, these are things that we\u2019re committed to that are going to drive growth for us long-term. And we\u2019ve got great projects in all 3 segments, either through new product launches, investigating new markets to leverage different applications for our technologies. And then even in the second quarter here, we\u2019ve got some larger trade shows that we\u2019re back in the largest North American trade show for Fire & Rescue that we\u2019re going to launch a couple new products and bring those to market. So a lot of exciting things across the portfolio that we\u2019re committed to investing, as we progress through the year like we talked about, we gave our initial guidance. And then, Eric, anything else you\u2019d want to add. Yeah, I\u2019ll hit it generally, like, Bill kind of fill in the blanks in terms of models and numbers. But, I mean, like we\u2019ve been, as you\u2019d suspect, very, very aggressive on the pricing front and talking about it for a long time, where we think we\u2019re entitled to it, given the differentiation and the problems that we solve out there. We\u2019ve worked at very systematically across the company, I mean, there\u2019s an approach to how we do that. So I would say here, as we\u2019ve talked through last year, we got some ways that the cycle came up, and the velocity of it was in many ways unexpected in the beginning of the year. I think as each month goes by the additional pricing actions we\u2019ve taken, we have seen increased inflation, the teams are doing a much better job getting out in front of it. Please proceed with your question. But I would say, just from what we can see here, it\u2019s just been a consistent story. In many ways, it\u2019s concentrated in certain areas that are more favorable than others, they would love to deploy capital and get at it sometimes at larger scale. But you just see, increasingly, I mean, that the bigger the project, the harder it is to put together, you\u2019ve got to have the people to do it, they\u2019ve got to be familiar with the company, and then you got to be able to marshal all the resources and count on it across a horizon that\u2019s going to be longer than it has been before, so all lead times are much longer than they have been. And so, I think, what we\u2019re seeing and in fact, even some of the things that I look at that we deploy in our own companies, you kind of go to the head of the list and you say, all right, well, where\u2019s the absolute place that we have to put some money to work and you can see the return sitting in front of us, because the demand is pronounced. And if you can do it in a slightly different way maybe it\u2019s a little bit faster, it\u2019s quicker the scale is of a different nature. And it\u2019s kind of it matches the deployment within our own business, which, of course, is sort of a different scale. So, I think, that bigger transformative project stuff that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s just that\u2019s the situations that it face, I don\u2019t know, when that ends, I guess, that\u2019s the open question for all of us. But, I see a lot of that related to, it\u2019s just got to find a way to settle into a very different planning environment that has been this way now for a while. But, I think, if folks had a magic wand, they would like it to go away, and they\u2019d like to put that capital to work. And then just a question on max and neutral in the quarter, just based on the backlog, and it\u2019s certainly the pricing items, but more on the mix side. No material impact on the year-over-year, I think, for us a lot of the margin mix will be just the FMT margin expansion that\u2019ll be more consistent this year relative to other productivity initiatives that we had last year, so more productivity driving the margin expansion versus favorable or unfavorable mix having major impact. Please proceed with your question. Hey, good morning, everyone. So I\u2019m just curious, like obviously with what\u2019s going on in Europe, some major themes around how we transfer energy and food shortages globally. But I like the way you framed it, which is actually anytime there\u2019s disruption, there are problems to solve, and that\u2019s usually healthy for us. So, as things swing around in production goes from one zone to another that means largely the infrastructure might be used in ways that\u2019s more aggressive or higher rates than it has before. We do things like custody transfer on the energy side, if we\u2019re shipping it around the world, or building out ports to do that, that\u2019s places that we play. And so, I think, ultimately, I\u2019d put that in the net favorable for us. Same thing over on food production, I mean, is that becomes a bigger deal and starts to move around in different geographies and things like that, where capital may be or may not be a need to be deployed, we come along with it with the mission critical fluidic solutions that we have in there as well. But I would say just the fact that they\u2019re changing, often presents opportunities for us in the ways that that I described here. What\u2019s your ability to kind of protect what\u2019s there, I assume that the duration of the backlog is long, and it\u2019s longer than it typically is. Yeah, in most of it, Joe, we\u2019ve been able to evolve our terms and conditions over the last 18 months to make sure that we can pass on incremental inflation as it comes into there\u2019s certain contracts that we have that we can\u2019t, but I think we\u2019re well positioned overall. Please proceed with your question. So there\u2019s a number of factors at play, some of which we turned to our advantage here in the quarter. I mean, from an external perspective, I\u2019d say the supply chain environment is basically the same difficult some subjects better, some worse, but that not really markedly different. The labor availability piece, I mean, we\u2019re low labor content, but it is critical, somebody eventually has to put things together, that actually improved for us in the first quarter, mainly from absenteeism. And I\u2019d say labor availability, generally, while it\u2019s a tough market out there for people, I mean, it did get a bit better for us. And we\u2019ve got less kind of open roles, especially in the production side overall. And then a lot of the work that we do, I mentioned in the remarks, it\u2019s tuning 80/20, from beginning to end supply right through the factory, right to the customer base. We\u2019ve kind of always naturally had that orientation and how we produce, the harder part is actually to draw those connections all the way back into the supply chain, and then move them around. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve done the best work here over the last really 6 months, but you saw the benefit in the last 3. So all that simply means is, you\u2019ve got your best supplier making the part, that\u2019s the most critical for our best part of the factory to our best customer set that alignment is in place, we\u2019ve got ways to query that across the company now. Last year, we\u2019re now, those are completely behind us and they\u2019re in parts of the business that have got good order velocity against them. Maybe just one follow-up from me on the capital allocation side, it\u2019s nice to see you deploy some cash to share buybacks. No, Vlad, I\u2019ll take that one. When we think the stocks undervalued, what we consider our intrinsic value of the company, we\u2019re back in buying shares. And, obviously, with the significant decline we\u2019ve seen here, and we think that\u2019s short-term related, a lot of the conversation, Eric\u2019s highlight is we\u2019re really bullish on the next couple years, both from an industrial cycle and our ability to put broader capital work in the M&A space. So we\u2019re taking advantage of where the share price is, and we\u2019re going to continue to buy at the current level, if we\u2019re still at this value here as we progress through the quarter. Please proceed with your question. I mean, it\u2019s a slight step down, I think, we\u2019ve said typically before we\u2019ve been somewhere in the point or two, things we wish we would have been able to get out or otherwise. And I\u2019d say, this is a slightly more favorable tune, or landing position for us, largely for a lot of the work that I just talked through there. I mean, I\u2019d say the one external component is that slight uptick in labor availability for us, recognizing again it\u2019s a relatively small part of kind of our spent in P&L. Scott, maybe I\u2019ll take that one. And as we progress through this year, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. Now, those have kind of normalized to some degree, and we\u2019re back looking at fast growing applications that kind of map to the world we see ahead of us. So we tune that fairly regularly and we\u2019re always looking at what should be up there, which should be \u2013 should not, we don\u2019t do that around sort of calendar cycles, we\u2019re continually evaluating that and saying, if we hit a milestone that would suggest something needs to come off, and we\u2019re seeing an opportunity elsewhere. And if I could just squeeze one in on dispensing, fourth quarter, the call you were a little bit of a lot got it on the dispensing outlook for this year, and then it looks like it had a pretty good first quarter. Yeah, Scott, I think that\u2019s a first half versus second half. We continue through the back half of last year to win some larger projects here in North America, that\u2019ll be delivered in the first half, so continued strength here over the second quarter, and then much more difficult comps in the back half of the year. Please proceed with your question. Well, I mean, if I go back to the comments, I had just a few moments ago, where I sort of delineated, the labor impact, which was positive for us, I mean, I would say almost all of that that\u2019s an external situation playing through, coming off the Omicron infection rates and higher absenteeism, and then that moderated as we went through the quarter. So I put that on the external side, that\u2019s a component, the tuning I talked about relative to 80/20, and supply chain, and how we move that through the supply base or resourcing. That\u2019s things we\u2019ve long been doing to try to keep pace with a very, very difficult supply environment. So I don\u2019t know with the exact balance, I would say, but you got some of both coming together there. And then I do want to ask you about China, I know that at this point, it\u2019s a relatively small portion of the footprint. I\u2019m wondering at this juncture in April, given the kinds of lock downs activity we\u2019ve seen there. Well, I think like everybody else were watching the current situation play out, I mean, pretty hard to predict how things are going to go, also hard to imagine that this is a big long-term event, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt be some overhang here. Our approach there is very local, it\u2019s completely local. So we\u2019ve got resources on the ground, we\u2019ve got technologies available, and we\u2019ve got domain expertise to solve local problems from within the economy. And so, that doesn\u2019t insulate it entirely from macro events that happen there, but it does minimize the sort of disruptive things you can get doing lots of cross border, and that\u2019s never really been our model there, it isn\u2019t the model for India as well, we have a similar campus there. And then, I still feel very confident about the investments we\u2019re making to be appropriate given the potential of that economy. Please proceed with your question. I think we\u2019ve covered a lot on the full year outlook, so just wanted to ask a couple on the near-term thoughts here. I mean, it seems like your overall messages demand looks strong and there aren\u2019t any sort of warning signs you\u2019re seeing, but you want to be conservative given the overall macro environment. I guess, I\u2019m curious, just in the second quarter, it seems like you are pointing to some potential for some margin compression. It depending on what your competence, there\u2019s kind of another 50 to 100 basis points, primarily through incremental investments on the discretionary and resource side. As we said, hey, we\u2019re going to have about $20 million, $25 million for each category this year. And then just in terms of capital deployment for the year, so the CapEx guidance for the full year would indicate that you\u2019re sort of accelerating there. Yeah, I think some of the big ones, Eric highlighted, continued investments in facilities in emerging markets are China expansion and India expansion, the CapEx associated with that\u2019ll ramp here over the next few quarters. So we\u2019re invested in that machine tools and equipment to do that, I wouldn\u2019t say within additive emphasis on the automation capabilities that are out there today, that also has a secondary benefit of helping us on the labor front. Please proceed with your question. Yeah, it\u2019s close to 3%. I mean, that\u2019s been very, very healthy. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a piece of that that\u2019s involved with COVID, or at a minimum the vaccine that therapeutic side of that, lots of interesting things going on with cell-based therapies and other things that are out there. So, I mean, it\u2019s an area of focus for us, we\u2019ve got a nice presence there that has done well, and we continue to stay very interested in it. Please proceed with your question. I\u2019d say from a high level there, none of this really comes back to specific areas of concern that map against where we are and kind of where we intersect the world out there. They\u2019re more general, and they\u2019re pretty close to the same ones that everybody else is thinking about. But there\u2019s a bunch of derivative impacts for us and others, we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at it, units of measure that are different than the ones that are on the macro screen for most people. Well, I mean, so like I \u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to do that specifically, because it goes in different businesses and goes in different places, I would just say, very, very strong on both of those categories. On the semi side, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 like we\u2019re involved in different aspects of that we\u2019re involved in some businesses, we kind of come in there on the fab side, when we build out infrastructure, and other places, we\u2019re actually involved in the metrology side, or the inspection of things that are made in that infrastructure. Please proceed with your question. I just wanted to see if you\u2019d round up discussion a little bit on capital deployment and acquisition, where you\u2019ve obviously been successful and steady in the past year, and to this quarter, 1Q and 2Q. Well, I think for a while we\u2019ve been talking about the intentionality of the work, so we resourced it in a different way, put some people on, brought some folks in from the outside, I mentioned, Roopa, in my earlier comments, she brings a lot to the effort as we go. And you can kind of see that if you look at the last few acquisitions in particular, they\u2019re all very close to home to our businesses. And, in fact, we\u2019ve known them for a long, long time. So in some ways, we\u2019re taking advantage of targets that have been out there that we\u2019ve understood with much more focused cultivation, understanding and ability to get the transaction done, and then integrate it successfully in the company. Right next to that, then is broadening that work and starting to think about, well, if you go slightly to the left or to the right, or extend out the time horizon a bit further, what does that suggest about the universe that\u2019s out there, which could be known in some cases isn\u2019t known. And so it\u2019s very, very focused work, it\u2019s process driven. Again, a lot of it is relatively close to home, because we\u2019re looking to leverage the domain expertise that we have the market insight and presence and positioning of current businesses. But it\u2019s coming together in an interesting way, and we long, et cetera, I\u2019d said, ever since I took the seat, I was trying to level loaded a bit. And that\u2019s now happened, it makes that resource base more stable, and makes the work more predictable, and it\u2019s easier to optimize. I mean, we\u2019ve got the \u2013 to complete the kind of growth maps that we have for the businesses, we\u2019re going to often want to bring in some technologies and position points that we don\u2019t have today. Please proceed with your question. We didn\u2019t cover a lot of ground, but I thought I\u2019d try and drill into a couple of things. And we have a big broad cross section of different markets, different pressure points, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick anything out specifically yet. And then, I think, Bill\u2019s remarks about the paint dispensing market. Yeah, Walt, I think overall, the paint markets strong, obviously, from time to time, there\u2019s large replenishment orders in North America that were coming off of the back of a huge cycle there that\u2019ll be have the tougher comps in the second half of the year. And you still have a lot of especially the Asia side of things is, I mean, it\u2019s just now automating we\u2019re still involved in that cycle, which is a little bit more steady state, less project specific. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to CEO, Eric Ashleman for closing remarks. Bill and I do our best to simplify the story here makes it seem easy enough, it\u2019s not. And I\u2019m really, really proud of how our teams have come together and made the improvements and progress they have here. It\u2019s reflective our mission and values, and when we do our job as well. So we\u2019re leaning forward, we feel good about where we are and look forward to talking with you, as we go about the progress we\u2019re making. And this concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time."
