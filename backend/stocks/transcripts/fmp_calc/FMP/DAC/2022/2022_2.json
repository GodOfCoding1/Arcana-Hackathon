    "content": " The increase of $88.2 million in adjusted net income between the two quarters is a result of an increase in operating revenues of $104.5 million and a $13.9 million net dividend book in relation to our ZIM equity holding partially offset by higher total operating expenses of $20.2 million, mainly due to the increase in the average size of our fleet by 11 vessels between the two quarters, a $7.8 million increase in net finance expenses, and a $2.2 million decrease in income from Gemini that was fully consolidated in the third quarter of 2021."
