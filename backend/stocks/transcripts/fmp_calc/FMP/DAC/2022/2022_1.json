    "content": "  This increase of $177.3 million in adjusted net income between the two quarters is the result of a $97.8 million increase in operating revenues and $110 million of net dividend booked in relation to our ZIM equity holdings, partially offset by higher total operating expenses of $22.9 million, mainly due to the increase in the average size of our fleet by 11 vessels between the two quarters, a $5.8 million increase in net finance expenses and a $1.8 million decrease in income from Gemini that was fully consolidated in the third quarter of last year. Vessel operating expenses increased by $8.1 million to $39.2 million in the current quarter from $31.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet, while the average daily vessel operating cost increased to $6,300 per day for the current quarter from 5,954 per day for the first quarter of last year, mainly due to COVID-19 related increases in crude remuneration and increased insurance expenses due to the higher insured values of the vessels in our fleet."
