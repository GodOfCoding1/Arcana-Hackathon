    "content": "  This increase of $67.4 million in adjusted net income between the two quarters is a result of a $64.1 million increase in operating revenues, and $11 million incremental net dividend booked in relation to our ZIM Equity Holding and a $2.5 million improvement in net finance expenses are fairly offset by higher total operating expenses of $10.2 million, mainly due to the increase in the average size of our fleet by five vessels between the two quarters and inflationary pressures that resulted in incrementally higher daily operating expenses."
