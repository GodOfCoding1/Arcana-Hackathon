    "content": " The higher revenues also reflect Medicare payments on DecisionDx-SCC, as Derek discussed earlier, and the effect of higher positive revenue adjustments related to tests delivered in previous periods associated with changes in estimated variable consideration, which were $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to a negative $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Cost of sales, exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets, for the three months ended June 30, 2022, increased by $4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to higher personnel costs, which have increased with additions in head count in our laboratory testing operations, including increased head count attributable to the acquisitions of Cernostics and AltheaDx."
