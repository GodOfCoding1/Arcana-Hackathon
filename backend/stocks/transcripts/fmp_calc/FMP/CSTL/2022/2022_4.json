    "content": " The increases in total revenue for the full year were partially offset by the effect of variations in revenue adjustments related to tests delivered in previous periods associated with changes in estimated variable consideration, which were net negative $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net positive $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. General and administrative expenses increased by $18.6 million or 49.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, with increases primarily attributable to higher personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and bonuses."
