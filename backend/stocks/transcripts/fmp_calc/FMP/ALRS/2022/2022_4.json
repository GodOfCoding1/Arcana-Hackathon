So Jeff -- sorry, Nate, this is -- the timing of the -- we kind of gave the guidance already on the previous question in terms of our margin, and I'd say our NII is going to follow somewhat a similar cadence to a lot of that, though, too, will be influenced by the talent adds we've had and also the loan growth we're doing from our current team. I would love to get your guys' updated thoughts on just kind of expectations for 2023 in terms of just overall kind of wealth management, RBMS revenue growth, assuming equity markets kind of stabilized, and we don't see much more valuation pressures from here with some of the initiatives that you guys are you're taking in terms of driving more durable kind of less market sensitivity within the business. The $12 million is based on our -- if you look at our ALM modeling that's disclosed on Page 62 of our 10-Q, you'll see that up 300 to 400 basis point scenario, it does decrease our NII, mainly due to repricing of our liabilities, which is going to be mainly our money market and interest-bearing deposits. Our enviable diversified business model with industry-leading recurring fee income, strong core deposit franchise with access to synergistic deposits robust reserves and regulatory capital and historically strong asset quality position our company well for attracting and retaining talent and growing our client base."
