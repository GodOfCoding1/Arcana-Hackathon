    "content": " Excluding the impact of PPP and Metro, average core loans increased 8.1% on a linked quarter basis, which was in line with the guidance provided. Excluding the impact of Metro, average deposits declined 2.7% on a linked quarter basis due to a seasonal decline in interest bearing deposits in the second quarter that lingered into the third quarter. While average balances were down in the quarter, we did see the typical seasonal increase during the fall as end-of-period core deposits, excluding Metro, were up 1.7%. Excluding the impact of PPP and Metro, net interest income increased 5.7%, mainly due to higher loan growth and higher net interest margin. Excluding the impact of Metro, our core net interest margin was 3.04%, an increase of six basis points from the prior quarter, which is consistent with the guidance we gave of margin expansion. Excluding the impact of Metro and merger-related costs, noninterest expenses were down 0.4%, which was in-line with our expectations of core expenses being flat over the prior quarter. We saw some pull forward of loan growth in the third quarter ahead of further rate hikes as we have previously experienced loan growth of 18.2%, excluding Metro and PPP, since the end of 2021. Wealth revenues will be stable as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not anticipating any equity or bond market growth, and then for retirement, excluding the onetime planned restatement fees from the SECURE Act, in third quarter results, we expect retirement revenues to increase by low single digits."
