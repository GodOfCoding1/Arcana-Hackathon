    "content": " On a year-over-year basis for Q3, excluding foreign exchange impact, both Gogoro hardware and Gogoro network revenue increased, gross margin increased, sales of hardware and network services in Taiwan met expectations and we continue to focus on international opportunities. We saw strong growth of nearly 30% in the Gogoro network business, record quarterly revenue of $33.2 million on a constant currency basis, and we continue to keep a close to 100% attach rate of customers. Despite the slow two wheeler market so far in 2022 as described by Horace, in the first nine months of the year electric vehicles as a percentage of total vehicles increased by 9.7% versus 2021. We also continue to accumulate subscribers on our Taiwan Gogoro Network, and are most pleased with those results as they demonstrate continued growth and accumulating subscriber base and recurring revenue generated by our battery swapping business model. Gogoro network revenue for the third quarter was $30.4 million, up 17.7% over year and up 28.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, indicating that revenue would have been $2.8 million higher without the exchange rate impact. The pilot we're launching in Delhi also allows Zypp and others to test out and see firsthand the benefits of battery swapping, the actual user experience on the Gogoro network, as well as providing greater user impact through Gogoro we can actually continue to improve and enhance our services. As Taiwan has now eliminated its inbound quarantine, we are seeing lots of interest for people to make trips to Taiwan, to personally observe how our network work, personally observe our vehicles, personally ride those vehicles and then work with us to figure out how to either turn on new countries or turn on new markets or for us to be able to access new customer bases through those visits."
