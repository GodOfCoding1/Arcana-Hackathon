    "content": " The increase was primarily due to non-IFRS gross profit increasing to $14.1 million, up 28.1% from $11 million in the same quarter last year, as a result of the continuous growth of the Gogoro Network business in the second quarter. And we're targeting relatively flat market share to last year for the second half of the year, we might see a slight seasonal pickup in sales for Gogoro Network partners as well as the overall market that would be largely driven by seasonality. And then finally, Taiwan generating the lion's share of our revenue, we did previously expect that we would get about 10% of revenue from international markets, what we're finding is largely because of the COVID situation and the even broader market conditions in China, and in other international locations, that we're going to see a short-term delay in terms of those markets picking up. Within that context of electric Gogoro vehicles grew in the first half versus first half of last year, and then are powered by the government network the requirements also grew 3.5% on the Gogoro side 10.5% on the partner vehicle side and 60% for electric as a percentage in total in terms of growth. But we certainly aren't banking on that if we set our guidance for the back half of the year, we're expecting roughly flat market share to where we are at the moment, which is roughly in the 9% to 10% range for the Taiwan -- for the Gogoro branded vehicles in the second half of this year. And I think number two has to do with reliability of our system, and having over 1 million batteries now deployed in Taiwan, being able to be in a number of other markets moving -- mostly we don't know that, for example Gogoro today is doing a lot of delivery in B2B business for our partner in South Korea, as well as powering a ride sharing fleet in Germany."
