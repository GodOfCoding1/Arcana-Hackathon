    "content": " Yes, we build and sell our own branded vehicles, which continue to be among the best-performing electric 2-wheelers available in the market today, but we also enable a total of 10 brands to sell over 47 different SKUs of vehicles on our battery swapping platform to take advantage of the battery swapping network we have developed and deployed. Sales of hardware and other revenues for the first quarter was $65.1 million, up $87.1 million from $34.8 million in the same quarter last year, primarily as a result of increased market share in Gogoro branded scooter sales in Taiwan. Gogoro Network revenue for the first quarter was $29.4 million, up 23% from $23.9 million in the same quarter last year. So we're providing guidance of revenue in the range of $460 million to $500 million for the full year 2022, which represents an anticipated increase of 25.7% to 36.6% compared to full year 2021. We're able to do that all remotely with both a telematic system that's on this station, but also at the same time with all services and tools that we've been working so hard to prepare for over the last several years as we kind of refine our system in Taiwan going through, as Bruce mentioned earlier, generations of batteries and generations of stations and generations of AI tools and machine learning system in the backside to be able to launch successfully in both of those markets earlier this year."
