    "content": " Although, our performance for the year was impacted by global supply chain and market conditions, we continue to execute and progress against our long-term strategic growth strategy with an expanded pipeline of $8 billion and quality projects, and an ending backlog of $704 million, a 19% increase compared to the end of 2021. As Kenny stated, our strong results for the fourth quarter were propelled by continued execution of our growth strategy and drove us to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target of more than $70 million for the full year of 2022. And we're seeing a pipeline starting to increase on specifically around those combined technologies, because of the IRA advancements here in the U.S. What we've done is just basically taking the approach like we mentioned last year and looking at our projections this year and going into next year, you see we're living in this era of this current supply chain aspects. It's always unique, because we -- if you take out this anomaly of a COVID year and anomaly of a supply chain impacts that we had last year and look at the end of '22 and look in -- we look at 2023 that business overall just continues to operate and perform at very solid margins, and we continue to look at how we can expand internationally and we continue to look at how we can expand it by through reverse engineering of competitive technologies, but it's just a solid state business."
