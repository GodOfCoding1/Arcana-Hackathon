    "content": " And I want to recognize the tremendous strides we have made as a company within our environmental and renewable energy business through the recent contract awards that have been announced, as well as our continuing efforts and evolving ClimateBright de-carbonisation platform and the scale up of our BrightLoop, decarbonisation hydrogen and cin gas production technologies. While the pandemic and global supply chain challenges have continued to cause delays for some project bookings are pushed back start dates of certain projects, bookings for the quarter remain very strong at 245 million increasing 46% compared to the same quarter a year ago, with a significant portion derived from the increased volumes within our renewable business segment. Backlog at the end of the quarter was 731 million in a robust pipeline of more than 7.5 billion of identified global project opportunities in the next three years, positioned us well for multiyear growth and we are preparing to capitalize on the positive impacts across our customer base as demand for a long term energy security and decarbonisation technology grows. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re obviously like everyone else piecing together the impact of that legislation that anticipate getting signed here into law, but and have been in discussions with a few around some of the particulars around that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve, as I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in the past publicly have spent a great deal of time with the Department of Energy and also various federal and state level organizations around trying to leverage a lot of the tax credits and initiatives coming from this."
