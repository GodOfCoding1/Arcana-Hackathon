    "content": " This variance is primarily related to the negative impact of the global supply chain challenges and geopolitical issues Kenny mentioned above, as well as several non-recurring, non-operational items such as the non-cash impairment of goodwill, which I'll discuss in a moment, in our Solar business of $7.2 million, which was recorded this quarter, and also a gain on the sale of an asset in at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for $13.8 million and a onetime recovery of $6.3 million, both of which occurred in the 2021 quarter and they're onetime items, so they would not be repeated in the 2022 quarter."
