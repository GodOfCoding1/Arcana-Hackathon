    "content": " We also have a tremendous team of dedicated employees who continue to be focused on safety, on strong project execution, on growing bookings and our backlog and on really stepping up to drive forward and support the world\u2019s climate objectives, while also providing the products and services our customers need to meet the energy demands not only just today, but also in the future. But we\u2019ve also -- as you can see in the balance sheet, we increased inventory by I think roughly USD10 million-ish, somewhere in that category, but we increased inventory to help compensate for some of those lagging parts, so that we were in a position to leverage our parts business, in particular, in the fossil fuel sector when a lot of our clients have been running those plants 24/7. And because of the situation in Ukraine and as well as COVID, but most of our contracts, we do a really good job of making sure, and obviously, over the past couple of years because everything has been gone with COVID, even more so to make sure that we\u2019ve got flexibility if we have to redirect supply chain or pricing goes up on some of the core materials and parts, so that the impact isn\u2019t necessarily borne by -- on B&W, is passed along to our customer base."
