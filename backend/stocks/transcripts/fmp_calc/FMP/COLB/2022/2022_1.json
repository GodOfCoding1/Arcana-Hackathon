    "quarter": 1,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-04-21 16:56:04",
    "content": " First quarter pre-tax, pre-provision income of $67.4 million, net income of $57.5 million and earnings per share of $0.74 were all new first quarter highs in spite of $7.1 million of merger related costs which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Linked quarter pre-tax, pre-provision income increased by $704,000 adjusting for merger related costs, PPNR decreased by $4.1 million partly due to the seasonal reset of payroll taxes and benefit costs, as well as increased expense related to the higher starting wage we implemented at year end and more recent annual merit adjustments. Noninterest expense of $105.1 million increased by $2.4 million linked quarter, after adjusting for merger related expenses of $7.1 million in the first quarter and $11.8 million in the fourth quarter, noninterest expenses increased by $7.2 million to $98 million. The linked quarter increase was mostly due to the aforementioned rise in compensation costs and loan expenses, as well as a $2.5 million increase in the provision for off balance sheet liabilities. As a result of higher rates, we saw a drop in our mortgage warehouse business during the quarter, with total  loans dropping from $75 million to $57 million. The new teams are starting to hit their strategy, you know, it takes a little time, a team that we announced that came on at the end of the fourth quarter, they're about 90 days with us and we'll start to see some positive impact from them as well."
