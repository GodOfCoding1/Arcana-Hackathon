    "content": " Notwithstanding these competing priorities, our bankers delivered outstanding full year results: annual net income exceeded $250 million for the first time in our history; full year EPS expanded by 15% to a new high; loans rose by 11% during the year, after adjusting for PPP runoff; and our operating efficiency ratio fell below 50% in the fourth quarter. Your line is now open. David, yes, you mentioned the part of that is it more competitive in certain markets, and I would tell you it's -- all markets are competitive and it's different competitors in certain markets, but you're seeing lots of deposit specials, things of that nature, really happy with the team and how they're working with our clients to find out what the purpose of the funds were, trying not to become interest rate sensitive when we don't have to, and utilizing the tools that are available through wealth management and such. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Because the -- you are seeing an acceleration here through the year on the liability side, but I think if you look at where the new asset yields are coming on, and then continue to see a little bit of mix shift as we utilize those cash flows coming off the investment securities portfolio, I think we should see them at least be matched if we're not seeing continued expansion overall between the two. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.
