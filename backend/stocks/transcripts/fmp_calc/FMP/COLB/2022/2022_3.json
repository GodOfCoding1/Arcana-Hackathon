    "content": " This increase was largely due to $3.7 million of higher compensation expenses, resulting mostly from higher incentive payouts, a drop in capitalized loan origination costs from lower but still strong production and a return to normal 401(k) matching expense after a favorable true-up of approximately $900,000 in the second quarter. As a result of higher rates, we continue to see a decline in our residential mortgage production with sold loans dropping from $39 million linked quarter to $18 million for the third quarter. So it's really -- honestly, it's really full service and getting to know the client, what they're really looking for and then probably even more importantly, finding that we're all of their other deposits and money are housed and really surrounding that relationship. And I think that's really important and a sign to how not only our bankers, but our clients are seeing the opportunities of the pending combination and the products and services and the complete set that we'll have going forward, and they're making those moves now. I mean we're meeting weekly with the teams coming together and evaluating systems and what the conversion on all aspects of that is going to look like and -- both from an employee experience, from a customer experience and making sure that it's going to be as seamless as it possibly can be."
