    "content": " Total investment securities decreased $458 million during the quarter to $7.3 billion, which was split 70% available for sale and 30% held-to-maturity. Service charges -- excuse me, service charges on deposit accounts increased by $1.1 million largely due to a $685,000 increase in sweep account fees, which are reported on a gross basis with a similar offsetting amount recorded to legal and professional expense. And finally, the second quarter also benefited from FAS 91 capitalized loan origination costs owing to the very strong loan production in the period and that reduced compensation expense by about $1 million compared to the first quarter and about $0.5 million compared to the average of recent periods. The provision for income taxes increased $565,000 on a linked-quarter basis to $16.2 million representing a 21.6% effective rate."
