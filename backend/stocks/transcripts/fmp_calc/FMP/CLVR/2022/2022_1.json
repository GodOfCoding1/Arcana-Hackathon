    "content": " We expanded our existing relationship with Cannatrek, a research-driven medical cannabis operator into a two-year $3.6 million take-or-pay agreement in which we will begin supplying one strain of our high THC flower from Portugal alongside the CBD oil products we already supply. This increase was driven by continued sales strength in our nutraceutical business as well as significant year-over-year growth in our cannabinoid revenues, which increased 195% to $2 million compared to $0.7 million in the year ago quarter. That said, our adjusted gross profit, which excludes the inventory write-down in the first quarter of 2022 increased 25% to $2.9 million compared to $2.3 million in the year ago period. Net loss in the first quarter of 2022 increased $16.1 million compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2021, primarily driven by a $4 million restructuring expense, offset by increase in loss due to $1.7 million of debt discount write-off and loss on debt extinguishment of $2.3 million due to extinguishment of debt as offset on gain, remeasurement of warrant liability. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2022 was negative $6.7 million compared to negative $5.5 million for the same period in 2021 due to inventory write-down, increased R&D expenses for Colombian smokable dry flower and additional sales and marketing activities."
