    "content": " Our all-in cost per gram of dry flower equivalent in the third quarter of 2022 was $1.13 per gram, compared to $0.15 per gram in the year ago period. Our gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 was $0.3 million, which included a $1.7 million inventory provision compared to $1.9 million, which included a $0.7 million inventory provision in the year ago period. Our adjusted gross profit, which excludes the inventory provision in the third quarter of 2022 was $2 million, compared to $2.6 million in the year ago period. As a result of the headwinds we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed in our revenue performance, as well as adverse conditions in the broader cannabis market, we performed an interim impairment assessment on our indefinite intangible assets related to our Colombian licenses and recognized a total impairment charge of $19 million during the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 improved to negative $5.4 million, compared to negative $6 million in the year ago period. In sum, with the improvements across our flower product in Portugal, the launch of our Colombian flower, the expected growth in our extract orders, our expanded pipeline and our enhanced commercial capabilities, we currently expect 2022 to be a year of significant growth for Clever Leaves."
