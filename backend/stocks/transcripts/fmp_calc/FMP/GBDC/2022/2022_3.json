    "content": " Slide 11 shows that GBDC's overall portfolio mix by investment type remained consistent quarter-over-quarter, with one-stop loans continuing to represent over 80% of the portfolio at fair value. And I think Jon and Gregory both made this point in their remarks, I think it's important enough to reiterate, the calendar Q2 results that we just discussed don't really reflect the full benefit or even most of the benefit of higher base rates, because our borrowers generally did not see resets in their loans until either late in the quarter or perhaps not even at the time of the end of the quarter. I'd also add a bit of a caution on this, in that while I anticipate new originations going to be okay in the coming period, we are seeing a more generalized slowdown in deal activity in Q3 and my expectation is that's going to continue into Q4 as a result of the decline in equity markets and the more challenging debt environment for new deals. And what Fin is referencing is if you look at the Golub Capital Altman Middle Market Index over recent quarters, the most recent quarter showed sustained good solid growth across the portfolio in revenues, but slower growth in EBITDA, reflecting some margin compression that I think is largely attributable to inflation."
