    "content": " This slide also shows GBDC's consistent and solid adjusted NII, adjusted NII before the capital gains incentive fee accrual, adjusted net realized and unrealized gains, EPS and distributions over the last several quarters. If I look across the portfolio at a bunch of different measures not just the middle market index, but also the performance ratings 94% in Category 4 and 5, the low level of non-accruals, 1.1% at fair value; the performance of specific companies when it\u2019s a number of companies that have been historical underperformers are actually improving, my overall sense for the portfolio performance is actually quite positive."
