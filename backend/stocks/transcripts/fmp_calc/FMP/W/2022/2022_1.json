    "content": " And I think what's interesting is we tried to call this out last quarter, and I mentioned the degree to which we think the availability of the key items in the back half of 2021 hurt us, and we talked about how we're going to stop purchasing some other things were painful, that we didn't have, and we didn't have the key items and so on and so forth. So I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is that, so the headcount -- non-OpEx head count, like, you're talking about customer service or the fulfillment headcount, they're very much tied to today's order volume, today's order flow, the number of orders going through our transportation network, the number of phone calls we're getting tied to today's orders."
