    "content": " For example, Perigold, which grew net revenue at approximately 30% year-over-year in Q2 and is scaling quickly in general, operates at a higher advertising level in percentage terms than does Wayfair, part of that is due to its smaller repeat base and its higher cost of brand marketing as a percentage of revenue, but it is also because of its higher level of profitability, which justifies our ability to pay more to acquire customers while remaining well within our efficiency parameters. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so, there's things like that, that are happening that we think are positive things that we're seeing with our customer base that is engaged, but engage with in the context that HomeGoods is not top of the agenda right now. Your line is open. Your line is open."
