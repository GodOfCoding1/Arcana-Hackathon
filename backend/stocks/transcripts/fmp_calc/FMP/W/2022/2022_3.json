    "content": " And so when we kind of looked at our cost structure with a fresh set of eyes, there's just a lot of things there that we just saw that, frankly, while we're just busy managing that dramatic growth from the $9 billion overnight to up over 50% because of COVID, there's a period of extended period of time where maybe not everything was equally focused on as much as it should be. Well, either we're taking out cost that's not providing customer benefits, that's neutral if you think about that doesn't hurt the customer, or it's positive if you think about the fact that in some cases, they lower retails or some of the cost optimization we're doing in transportation actually increases the speed of delivery. So we're like net doing things that are making retails better, making speed better, taking out costs where we think it's adding, not adding to value. So that 500 million is what we're -- what Niraj was sort of just referencing on the gross margin line, about 40% of that 500 million, we think about is operational cost savings and improvements that will flow through in that gross margin. I think the thing that's complicating the ad cost outlook right now that makes it murky is the thing I tried to talk about earlier, this free channel, pay channel mix shift which is affect a by-product to the macro environment, and you will -- just like you've seen it go one way you'll see it reverse back."
