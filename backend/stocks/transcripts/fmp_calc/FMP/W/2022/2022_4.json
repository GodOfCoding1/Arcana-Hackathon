I think you're actually seeing the declines there moderate in the fourth quarter, and that's part of what you spoke to in the orders being elevated as you start to bring on some new customers. About $80 million that is interesting, but also implies that you've touched the majority of home purchasing households in the U.S., and you think that, that still is active ground to reacquire those customers as opposed to customers who have already experienced Wayfair and will come back. Seth, we think there's actually a lot of folks we also have not yet had purchased from us because remember, that $80 million would include not just households or consumers, it would include the B2B customers and the Wayfair Professional business is a smaller piece of our total business, but meaningful and it would include all the international geographies, both B2C and B2B as well. Your line is open. Your line is open."
