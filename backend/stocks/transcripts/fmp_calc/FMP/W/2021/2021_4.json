    "content": " Your line is open. When you talk about some of the improvements you're seeing, what I will say is that on one hand, to see continued gains in growth rate when you look at how it's going to play out sequentially, you obviously need the macro to get back to kind of a stable place, which we think is headed there. Your line is open. And so I think when you start talking about customer expectations to kind of one-day delivery, same-day delivery at competitive costs with great reverse logistics and a great experience, convenient scheduled delivery and, in our case, you're talking about a lot of 2-person deliveries and assembly and putting things in the backyard or putting them in a bedroom or what have you, that matters a lot. And so obviously, as we run more -- as CastleGate penetration grows, we run more through that part of what gives us the confidence in our 27% to 28% gross margin targets over time and sort of how we're building the business going forward. Your line is open. Your line is open."
