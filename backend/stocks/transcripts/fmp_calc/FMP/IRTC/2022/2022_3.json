    "content": " With the customer advisory notice and based on other considerations discussed, we have adjusted our Zio AT forecast for the quarter to grow closer to approximately 20%, which is a step down from the upper 40% growth we had seen through the first nine months of the year. As mentioned, third quarter results demonstrated steady growth in our core business as revenue grew to $103.9 million, representing 22% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter growth. Your line is open. But when you think about the impact on guidance in the quarter, in the fourth quarter in particular, I think about it as roughly a $1 million or so from the received device rate just being a bit lower than what we've historically seen. Your line is open. So coupled the fact that we saw incredibly strong registration growth in the month of September, and that received device rate beginning to bend back towards, what we've seen historically, we felt good with respect to the full-year number and where we were at, we felt very strong, particularly with respect to the strong registrations. Your line is open. And that's something that we've been able to favorably impact over the past 12, 18 months, particularly as we think about better ways to inform those patients with respect to how to apply the device, putting a phone call out to those Home Enrollment patients to ensure that they actually do apply the device. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
