    "content": " We were pleased with our first quarter revenue performance growing by 24% year-over-year to $92 million, fueled by strong unit volume growth as well as the benefit of the improved Novitas pricing that went into effect January 1. So how we thought about that was more or less passing through the beat of the first quarter, which, call it, roughly $3 million or so, and then increasing for the impact that we believe we can get from the NGS reimbursement over the remainder of the year, which is really going to be in the back half by the time we're able to get the resources utilized the way we want to. Less than 25% of the market utilizes extended wear patch technology and for the most part, continues to utilize the older traditional Holter monitor, which we know is just not a very good solution, and there's such an improvement out there with the ZIO that we believe it should be the standard of care and the gold standard in the space and that ultimately, we're going to see market adoption move to that 75%, 80% of volumes over time. So I think for the next couple of years, you're going to hear us talk a lot about just really refining our focus, our discipline of calling on those accounts, increasing visibility into it and really creating awareness and education to convert what sits in front of us in the core market. David, I would just -- on that, while we're talking about seasonality, as we think about the second quarter, I just -- keep in mind that the NGS benefit, to Doug's point, is likely to come in the back part of the year. And I think I shared this across the entire company, we couldn't be more excited about the future that sits in front of this organization, not only in the core markets that we serve where we know there's a significant runway of opportunity in a greenfield to continue to get after, but the adjacent markets have us excited as well."
