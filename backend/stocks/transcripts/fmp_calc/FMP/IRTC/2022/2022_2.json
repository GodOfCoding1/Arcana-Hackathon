    "content": " In terms of longer-term reimbursement, I think that's going to continue to take some time to build up and create evidence with, but I do see it on the commercial payer side, something that's very interesting and quite a bit of engagement with our partners that are out there and look forward to sharing much more of that in the Analyst Day. We're expecting significant growth in this company as we think about the terrific opportunity in existed core market, just to move this to the standard of the year, but then to expand into the primary care channel, there's tremendous volume growth that's going to sit in front of us. I think the marketing aspect becomes a much bigger part of who we are and how we move forward and how we create awareness but not only awareness, education that articulates why we're unique and different just versus any other monitoring capability that's out there because we truly are differentiated with our AI capability, the algorithmic efforts that have been put forward in the data that stands behind our products. I won't give around way specifics of exactly how we're looking at that product offering, but we are looking to continue to evolve it and I think become even more effective player in that space where I don't see any reason why we can't hold the same sort of market share there that we hold in the XT business over time as we continue to educate and close that gap on the product side. That's great to see in terms of the results that we're putting up in terms of the new account openings, but it's also being done without what I think are the most effective and most efficient tools that we can create. And so think of the $7 million, $3.5 million a quarter, that's the incremental benefit you're going to see going forward for the rest of this year."
