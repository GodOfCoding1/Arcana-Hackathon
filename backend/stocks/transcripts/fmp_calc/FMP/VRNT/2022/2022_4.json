    "content": " Overall, we finished the year with strong bookings across existing and new customers, and we believe our booking momentum is driven by both our open AI-powered cloud platform as well as by the strength of our partnerships. Your line is open. I think with everything you\u2019re saying you\u2019re now well above the midpoint of the transition, net new customer growth is strong, pipeline seem healthy, your on-cloud prem transitions are picking up. And if we have the same dynamic this year, obviously we\u2019ll be able to accelerate cloud revenue growth as well because we see the maintenance I spoke about; we have $250 million of maintenance conversion. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So \u2013 and I don\u2019t expect this to be a major revenue stream, but I think it is important overall to get platform adoption, both by partners as well as end users because the greater ecosystem we develop around Da Vinci, the more value, not just variant. Your line is open."
