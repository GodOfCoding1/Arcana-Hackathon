    "content": " Looking ahead, we expect strong cloud momentum and are raising our annual guidance to cloud revenue growth by 200 basis points to a range of 32% to 34%. First, cloud revenue increased by 38% year-over-year, driven by new logos, customer expansions and strong cloud conversions. You will hear from multiple Verint executives, and we will cover the following topics: recent market trends and the Verint opportunity to help brands close the engagement capacity gap; our strategy to increase differentiation and deliver even more ROI to customers; a cloud platform and a deep dive into Da Vinci AI; and finally, our financial model. It means basically that customers can buy new functionality that we have in the Verint platform they can buy that in the cloud, regardless of whether they want to maintain the legacy solutions on-prem or they are ready to move their legacy solutions to the cloud. And when you look at our 38% growth in cloud revenue last year, 2/3 came from selling new functionality, but also some of it to customers that didn't want to move to the cloud with their legacy. I don't see a reason because there's no pressure, but we do see acceleration in cloud overall, both in terms of booking in Q1, we had tremendous 27% growth in new booking and shift to SaaS. And this is our very-focused objective after the spin is really we are focusing on this one thing, introducing an AI-powered platform to help customers close this gap and not have to deal with the 97% of the cost keep increasing because industry -- the industry needs to hire more people."
