    "content": " We're excited to share that today marks the one-year point since we completed patient enrollment of GATHER2, our second Phase 3 clinical trial for Zimura, a novel C5 complement inhibitor for the treatment of geographic atrophy or GA. We look forward to reporting the top line data GATHER2 in September of this year, approximately one year after enrolling of the last patient plus the time needed for database lock and analysis. Following a potential positive outcome of GATHER2, we plan to submit applications with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency for marketing approval of Zimura for GA. We're also very excited to have entered into a license agreement with DelSiTech, providing us a worldwide exclusive license to develop and commercialize the sustained release formulation of Zimura using DelSiTech's silica-based sustained release technology. The GATHER1 results, in which Zimura was observed to have a greater reduction of GA lesion growth as compared to sham, occurred with the vast majority of patients having lesions close to the foveal center point. Data from this post hoc analysis are also consistent with the results of our previously reported prespecified analysis of Zimura from the GATHER1 trial, demonstrating a reduction in GA lesion growth compared to sham observed regardless of lesion size or distance to the foveal center point."
