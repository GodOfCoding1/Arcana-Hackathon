    "content": " In GATHER1, a post-hoc analysis showed that the reduction in the mean rate of GA growth or slope analysis over 12 months was 27.7% with a descriptive p-value of 0.0063 for the ACP 2-milligram group as compared to the corresponding sham group using the Square rig transformation and 35.4% with a descriptive p-value of $0.0050 without using square root transformation, which we referred to as the observed GA area. These estimates are based on our current business plan, which includes the continuation of our ongoing clinical development programs for ACP and GA and Stargard including the recently initiated open-label extension trial, evaluating ACP for intermediate AMD, preparation and submission of an NDA and MAA for ACP in GA, continuing preparations for potential commercialization of ACP NGA in the U.S., pursuing DeltaTech sustained-release delivery technology and exploring additional sustained delivery technologies for ACP and the advancement of our IC-500 development program as currently planned."
