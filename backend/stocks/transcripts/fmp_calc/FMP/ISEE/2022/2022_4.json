    "content": " In 2022, we continued to deliver on our goal to deliver to provide potential treatments to patients suffering from retinal diseases with avacincaptad pegol or ACP achieving a statistically significant reduction in the rate of geographic atrophy progression at the 12 month pre-specified primary endpoint across two Phase 3 clinical trials. This morning, we announced results of a post talk analysis on the data from the ACP, GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trials signaling an up to 59% risk reduction in the rate of vision loss for the ACP 2-milligram dose compared to sham at 12 months of treatment. We also intend to pursue further discussions with the FDA but utilizing that GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trial data included in the current NDA submission to support treatment of GA associated with earlier stage disease, including patients with intermediate AMD. These results were consistent in the GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trials when analyzed independently, which signaled a 44% reduction with a hazard ratio of 0.56% and a 59% reduction with a hazard ratio of 0.41 respectively in the rate of vision loss for the ACP 2-milligram dose compared to sham after 12 months of treatment."
