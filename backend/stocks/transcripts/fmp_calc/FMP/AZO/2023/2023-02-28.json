    "content": " On a trailing four-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.5 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing 19% over last year. Our growth initiatives are doing just that and include, new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, hub and mega-hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.7 billion, up 9.5%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives and let me give a little more color on those growth initiatives. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q2 last year and total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries."
