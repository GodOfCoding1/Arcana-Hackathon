    "content": " Our domestic same-store sales were a solid 2.6% this quarter, on top of last year\u2019s very strong 28.9%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our commercial sales are just under $4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year ago, up 27%. As a reminder, it was last year\u2019s Q3 that had the massive stimulus payments that were distributed to consumers in the U.S. We ran a negative 4.5% comp this quarter on top of last year\u2019s record positive comps of 24.8%. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 54 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where mix drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 4.8%, a welcome trade-off that is a net positive for our business. EBIT for the quarter was $786 million, down 2.2% and versus the prior year\u2019s quarter, driven by last year\u2019s strong sales performance in DIY. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.9 million, down 7% from Q3 a year ago, although our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter was $6.1 million versus $5.3 billion in Q3 last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 21.4% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, down 0.6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $29.03, up 9.6% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 127.9% versus last year\u2019s Q3 of 123.9%."
