    "content": " On a trailing four-quarter basis, we generated $3.8 billion in annualized commercial sales versus $2.9 billion just a year ago, up 30%. As our DIY two-year stacked comp accelerated from the first quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on four consecutive quarters of more than 20% two-year comps in this more mature portion of our business. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 32.1% to $844 million and were up 46.8% on a two-year stacked basis. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past seven quarters. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 59 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 14.5%. Moving to operating expenses, our expenses were up 7.5% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged 264 basis points. EBIT for the quarter was $627 million, up 30.1% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Net income for the quarter was $472 million, up 36.4% versus last year's second quarter. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live."
