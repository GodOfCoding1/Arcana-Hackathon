    "content": " For fiscal year 2022, we more than covered the dividend of $1.30 per share with realized income of $1.65 per share which included $3.7 million of net realized gains or $0.19 per share. Net asset value decreased by $9.3 million, primarily -- or $0.59 per share year-over-year, primarily due to portfolio company specific issues, offset by realized earnings in excess of our dividends. Now one thing I'll share is that as rates continue to increase, you certainly reach a level where you could have some more stress on portfolio companies, but we think we've got a good ways to run before that will -- higher rates will be impactful. All other things being equal and kind of what we would expect from this year's earnings going into the following year, if we continue with $1.60 dividend then there might need to be a special dividend at the end of that year just because we expect to out earn $1.60 dividend. I mean you said you expect the portfolio to be, what was it, $850 million to $900 million this year, kind of stable in the first quarter. Or there's a couple of different ways to also think about it, have you guys run what fourth quarter NII would have been if base rates at 12/31 were in fact that whole quarter and/or could you provide the average base rate that your portfolio had for the duration of the fourth quarter."
