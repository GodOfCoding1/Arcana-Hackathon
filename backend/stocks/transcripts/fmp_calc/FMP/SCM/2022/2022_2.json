    "content": " I am pleased to report our results from the second quarter, in which we grew our investment portfolio to $852 million, more than covered our regular dividend, maintained asset quality and upsized our bank facility to $265 million. We continue to see many interesting opportunities and, as a result, had funded $49.5 million on a cost basis during the second quarter and another $32 million since quarter end. For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we covered our regular dividends of $0.28 a share with core net investment income of $0.29 per share. We had $3.6 million of realized gains during the quarter, which were offset by a realized loss from the disposition of our investment in HIMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first lien loan, resulting in a net realized loss of $353,000 during the quarter. We ended the quarter with an investment portfolio at fair value of $852 million across 83 portfolio companies, up from $838 million across 78 companies at March 31. During the second quarter, we invested $49.5 million in 7 new and 14 existing portfolio companies and received $30.4 million of repayments, for net portfolio growth at cost of $19.7 million during the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, this additional dividend is based on the significant realized gains we are generating, $23.7 million in 2021 or $1.22 per share, $3.5 million in Q1 and expected additional realized gains over the next several quarters. As noted earlier, we have had $3.1 million of net realized gains through June 30 and have generated an additional $1.75 million gain since quarter end. And then in terms of outlook on fundings, we funded $32 million since quarter end and have two \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and had two repayments for about $10 million, resulting in net portfolio growth of $21.9 million in the third quarter."
