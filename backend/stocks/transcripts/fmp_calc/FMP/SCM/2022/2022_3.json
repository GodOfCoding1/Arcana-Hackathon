    "content": " I am pleased to report our results from the third quarter, in which we grew our investment portfolio to $872 million, maintained the asset quality and notably generated $0.37 per share of GAAP NII. For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we covered our total dividends, both regular and additional of $0.34 per share with net investment income of $0.37 per share. This is effectively unchanged from four loans on non-accrual at June 30, which comprise 2.8% of fair value  With respect to dividends, in addition to our regular dividend of $0.28 per share in the aggregate for the fourth quarter, our Board declared an additional dividend for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share in the aggregate or $0.02 paid per month. As we discussed last quarter, this additional dividend is based on the significant realized gains we are generating, $23.7 million in 2021 or $1.22 per share, $4.7 million year-to-date in 2022 and expected additional realized gains in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect that in January, we will combine the regular and additional dividends into a regular dividend of $0.34 per share for the quarter, which is a 21% increase in the regular dividend."
