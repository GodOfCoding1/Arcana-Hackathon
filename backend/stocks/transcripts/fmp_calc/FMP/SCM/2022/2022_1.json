    "content": " I'm pleased to report solid results in the first quarter in which we grew our investment portfolio, maintained at net asset value, covered the dividend and generated $3.5 million of realized gains. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we covered our regular dividends of $0.28 per share, with core net investment income of $0.29 per share. During the quarter -- first quarter, we invested $74.5 million in 6 new and 7 existing portfolio companies and received just $10 million growth at cost of $68.8 million for the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, this additional dividend is based on the significant realized gains we are generating, $23.7 million before tax in 2021 or $1.22 per share and then $3.5 million in Q1 at expected additional realized gains in Q2. Looking forward, of course, subject to Board approval, we expect to continue this combined $0.34 dividend each quarter for the foreseeable future, which I'd note, represents at least based on yesterday's stock price of $13.09, an annualized yield of 10.4%. It's our plan to fully deploy the debentures this year, again based on activity, and so you could see the portfolio in total approach $900 million from roughly $850 million today."
