    "content": " As a comparison, orders for the fiscal 2023 third quarter, the last quarter prior to the onset of the pandemic were $135 million. Operating income was $7.1 million, or 3.8% of sales or using adjusted operating income, we generated $11.7 million, or 6.3% of adjusted operating margin, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The $463 million of backlog coming into the quarter, coupled with easing in the supply chain, supported production stability in the third quarter's record level of net sales. As a result of the relationship between past order bookings and the realization of sales, product order backlog remains historically high at $429 million at the end of the third quarter. Operating expenses increased 22.9% to $34.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared to $28 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. For the third quarter, we generated $12.4 million from operating operations, and for the nine months of the fiscal year, we have used $9.5 million in cash, primarily to grow working capital, especially inventory."
