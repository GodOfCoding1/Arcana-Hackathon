    "content": " Revenue for the second quarter was $221.2 million with earnings per share of $1.32, gross margin of 44.8% and the quarter end cash balance of $287.9 million. As mentioned before, the mature process technology market continues to be an area of strength for Axcelis, with 84% of second quarter shipments going to mature foundry/logic customers, 16% of shipments went to memory customers with NAND accounting for 14% and DRAM 2%. As a result, Axcelis now expects to achieve revenue of greater than $875 million in 2022 with gross margin of approximately 42.5%. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of between $220 million and $228 million, gross margin of approximately 42%, operating profit between $44.5 million to $47.5 million and earnings per share between $1.10 and $1.15. We're guiding Q3 gross margin of approximately 42%, driven by the expected shipment of a less favorable systems mix compared to Q2 and the increased impact of supply chain-related costs. You're not going to see this quarter, obviously, because you already got the guidance and you've got the full year, but I would expect by the time we get through a couple more quarters, we should start seeing things improve. So I just want to make sure that the gross margin in a 39% to 40% range is kind of what you're thinking for the fourth quarter, given those higher material costs and the timing of when those hit the income statement."
