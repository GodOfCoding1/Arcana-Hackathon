    "content": " For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue of approximately $240 million, gross margin of roughly 41.5% and operating profit of around $48 million and earnings per share of approximately $1.25. This, combined with sales of higher-value Purion product extensions allows us to target gross margin at greater than 45% in a $1.3 billion model. The Axcelis business thesis, which supports over $1 billion in revenues in 2023 and $1.3 billion over the next few years is based on the following 5 key points: First, the implant TAM has more than doubled in the last few years with the mature market segments representing greater than 60% of the total TAM. The $1.3 billion model looks like it gets you to almost $9 of earnings per share, which obviously is very strong earnings, but in the presentation, it seems like you're talking about the opportunity to pursue M&A outside of implant to continue the company's growth prospects longer term. And so as we said, Craig, we do expect it's a 2- to 3-year time frame that we get to the $1.3 billion in terms of the business, where we're making investment, both in the R&D side of the business or in the SG&A side of the business."
