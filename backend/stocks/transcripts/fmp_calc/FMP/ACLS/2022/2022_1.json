    "content": " Revenue for the first quarter was $203.6 million with earnings per share of $1.22, gross margin of 44.1%, and the quarter-end cash balance of $297.9 million. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $205 million to $215 million, gross margin of approximately 41%, operating profit of approximately $41 million and earnings per share of approximately $1. Our $1 billion model reflects continued gross margin expansion driven by a higher revenue from CS&I and Purion product extensions, incremental supply chain volume and value engineering, planned labor and quality improvements, and a return to a more typical supply chain and logistics environment."
