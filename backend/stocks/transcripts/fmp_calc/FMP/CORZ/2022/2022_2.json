    "content": " Cost of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2022 included depreciation expense of $49.1 million of which $46.5 million was from the self-mining segment. Gain from the sales of our digital assets was $11.8 million for the three months end of June 30, 2022, resulting from a total sales price of our digital assets sold up $265.8 million versus the carrying value of $254.0 million. Impairment of digital assets increased by $150.2 million for the second quarter, as a result of a decline in our price in the price of bitcoin, an impairment is recorded when the carrying value of our digital assets exceed their fair value based on current market pricing. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash outflows for infrastructure costs to build our purpose-built data centers of $238.5 million payments to vendors for our ASIC servers of $217.7 million, interest and principle payments on our outstanding debt of $72.7 million and payment of tax obligations for vesting of employee RSUs of $29.3 million. All said, despite the difficulties, our industry has endured this year, assuming a constant bitcoin price and modest growth in the global hash rate, we are on pace to generate nexus of $700 million in revenue and approximately $300 million in EBITDA."
