    "content": " But given this later booking profile, the lack of visibility in the second half of the year, volatility in oil prices for the 20% that's unhedged and the potential risk for COVID -- adverse COVID and Ukraine developments, it's still too soon to provide meaningful FY 2023 profit after tax guidance at this time. But due to the later booking profile, that lack of visibility in the second half of the year, the volatility of oil prices particularly for the 20% of our fuel that's unhedged, the possibility of negative COVID in Ukraine news flows means that recovery is potentially fragile this winter and that means it's too early to provide any meaningful profit after tax guidance for the full year."
