    "content": " As we announced at our recent AGM, we set out a much more aggressive and accelerated growth path for the next three years, which you'll see Ryanair grow from 149 million passengers pre-COVID to a new target of 225 million passengers by FY '26, incredible growth of 50% from what is already Europe's largest airline over that five-year period. 90% of the fleet unencumbered and net debt at \u20ac1.5 billion, so this enabled us, thanks to the strong cash flows in the business, as Michael said, to repay \u00a3600 million to the UK CCFF last week, five months ahead of target. There's clearly price gouging going on by those European, the ANSPs, which are government-controlled monopolies protected from any impact of the competition or downturn from COVID, but we're continuing, and I think the new order for Gamechanger aircraft will significantly lower our aircraft cost for the next, not just five years, but for the next decade. And that's why we're going to see a very accelerated recovery in traffic in Ryanair over the next five years, growing from 149 million passengers pre-COVID by 50% over the next five years, up to 225 million passengers. But more importantly, we're investing over $20 billion in a fleet of new Boeing 737 Gamechanger aircraft, which allow us to carry 4% more passengers but with 16% lower fuel burn and then 40% cut in noise emissions. And of course, carbon becoming a bigger issue, we're in a particularly good place there, where we've got all of our EUAs hedged at about \u20ac24 in EUA for this year, about 65% next year at just under 40%, which compares very well to \u20ac60 in EUA in the market at the moment. But with 210 Gamechangers that we bring over the next few years, and with the capacity that we already have, we're fairly comfortable that we'll have about 620 aircraft in fleet, delivering 225 million guests by FY '26."
