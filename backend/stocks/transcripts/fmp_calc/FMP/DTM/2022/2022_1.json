    "content": " Before we get started, I would like to remind you to read the safe harbor statement on Page 2 of the presentation, including the reference to forward-looking statements. On today's call, I'll start by highlighting some of our key results this quarter, then discuss the constructive fundamentals that are playing out around our assets, and our execution on previously announced projects. I'll pass it over to Jeff to review our first quarter financial results, and then I will close with some remarks on our future opportunities. So with that, we had a strong first quarter performance that puts us firmly on track for our plan for the year, and we are highly confident in our ability to achieve our 2022 guidance. On our Appalachia Gathering System, we reached agreements with two existing customers that will result in an attractive incremental expansion, with approximately 200 million a day of added system capacity, a significant term extension and an expansion of dedicated acreage. On our NEXUS pipeline, we executed a 5-year contract for $100 million a day of capacity with an investment-grade shipper at attractive rates. So it's been a very busy and productive quarter, moving the company forward. We currently have approximately 2 Bcf a day of access to LNG export markets, which our shippers have under long-term contracts. The strong gas price environment is also benefiting many of our customers, and we expect it to continue to improve their cash flows and credit metrics, making these customers stronger which will provide additional flexibility to grow production over time. In the Haynesville, production is continuing at record levels and strong rig activity points to a robust future growth. With takeaway capacity constraints in the basin, there is a high demand for any existing capacity or easily expanded capacity to get gas further downstream towards markets. Before I pass it over to Jeff, I wanted to give an update on our previously announced expansion projects, which will begin entering service starting the second quarter of this year as further detailed on Slide 14 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we delivered overall adjusted EBITDA of $191 million. Regarding our quarterly segment level performance, we had largely consistent results for both our pipeline and gathering segments compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Pipelines segment results include higher contributions from our pipeline joint ventures, offset by lower short-term contracted volumes on Stonewall. Operationally, our total gathering volumes across both the Haynesville and Appalachia averaged 2.9 billion cubic feet per day and included the continuing benefit of the new customer volumes on our Haynesville system, which were pulled forward into 2021. We are always evaluating ways to improve on an already strong position, which is why we recently took action with a bond issuance in the investment-grade market, which effectively converted 60% of our 7-year term loan to a 10-year senior notes. Less than a year since our spin-off from DTE, we have committed over 50% of our $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion 5-year investment plan to organic projects at attractive returns. In the Haynesville, the strong fundamental environment continues to provide tailwinds in our pursuit of a Phase II Haynesville system expansion, which remains a top priority for our commercial team. In Appalachia, we continue to have discussions on the NEXUS open season, and we'll keep pursuing favorable recontracting opportunities at improved rates. In our emerging third business platform, we continue our disciplined work to advance our CCS project in the Louisiana area towards an EPA Class 6 permit application filing. We're also putting the finishing touches on our inaugural sustainability report, which we plan to publish later this month. So in summary, I feel really good about the start to the year, and I am confident that we are on track to deliver on our full year '22 guidance and achieve our 2023 early outlook. The very strong fundamentals surrounding our assets has been very optimistic about the durability of our portfolio, which supports our future growth opportunities and the company's performance over the long term. Your line is open. With the new NEXUS contract there, I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more. Given the strong price signals for Appalachia producers to drill, they really just -- they don't want to drill and flood the basin they want to drill and go to a market. All that information will become public Jeremy, for you guys to look at on the NEXUS website through the FERC process. But yes, we're seeing strong rates, I'll just say it that way. We're really looking at how can we expand the export capacity out of the basin incrementally with an easy low-risk, low-cost expansion opportunity. And then turning, I guess, to the Haynesville, just wondering, there seems to be competition down there for new pipe. That's a great question, Jeremy. But if you really just step back, you can see that there's a really strong demand like that, that 78 Bcf is real over the next 7 to 8 years. But when we get beyond that 2 Bcf a day with compression, we can go up to 3 Bcf a day as we begin to look the system. So again, doing it all inside our right away inside our footprint, again, it can be done incrementally as the demand is in and the producers are ready to make those commitments. We're going to expand -- we're in flight now expanding the system for 300 million a day and again, look to keep adding increments as we progress here with customers. And just one last one, if I could, as it relates to carbon capture development within Louisiana. Any other thoughts you could provide, I guess, on time line when this could become more real and just really Classic wells, Louisiana seeking primacy there, thoughts on time line or anything else on this topic that you could provide more color on would be helpful. So we're -- the way I'll describe it, Jeremy, we're just -- we're following our very disciplined development plan. I think as you -- as we've talked before, Louisiana is trying to get primacy. Our plan is -- we will file regardless of whether Louisiana has primacy or not, just because these applications take some time to go through the regulatory process anywhere from two to three years. So again, that's part of that disciplined development that the team is adhering to where we're just methodically doing all the homework and the due diligence in the right way so that when we do file that application, it's a high-quality application. The regulators know what's going to be in it before we file it, and it can progress through the process in a smooth fashion. And it's also somewhat of a -- as you're acquiring the rights that you need to do this, again, that disciplined approach. Your line is open. To go back to a comment, just some comments you made about supply chain and cost issues as related to the growth projects. Are you saying that kind of in spite of those issues and inflation that we're seeing, the cost for your projects really hasn't changed materially. So when we FID the projects, we factored in what I'll call the supply chain realities that we were seeing in the market. And really, what I'm saying here, Michael, is just confirming that those projects remain on track, on budget. Year-over-year, the volumes are up pretty substantially, I think, like 18%, but your EBITDA is up only modestly year-over-year. Yes, one thing when you think about year-over-year, you're referring to first quarter, first quarter, as remember, there's public company costs that's planned through. But of course, when you look at our 2022 guidance and then even our 2023 guidance, you can see the planned growth, both the new projects and within the business that, that growth is planned through both of those. Yes, that's really the answer there is that you're comparing a Q1 inside DTE where we didn't have the stand-alone incremental public company costs. I'm going to pull back to the higher level is that when we -- on the year-end call when we announced the Haynesville system expansion, and I'll just talk on the gathering side, just to put it in perspective, we announced a 25% increase in our gathering system in that expansion. So just to put it into perspective, are we -- is our Haynesville gathering system growing with production. I think the answer is clear that it is, we're going to grow that system by about 25% with that announced expansion. Your line is open. I know last quarter, you also talked about some of the shorter-term contracts that are pulled in the fourth quarter. So the way I think about it at a high level quarter-over-quarter, we have relatively flat volumes on the Haynesville system. And yes, I think we noted that we had some planned maintenance that showed up in March in the first quarter. And those are detailed thought I believe, on Slide 14 in the deck that sort of walks the growth that will occur second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter this year and we ramped that up. And again, it's fully contracted with an anchor shipper. And just to remind everybody that we had a really strong fourth quarter last year, we pulled forward into the fourth quarter, a number of new customers that came on the system that we didn't expect were going to come on until kind of the end of the year. Yes, we're going to be seeing other expansions that we've previously announced showing up in Q2, but not on the Haynesville system. Our approach right now on that is, again, just taking a very disciplined look at things, and they have to -- they would have to strategically fit and they obviously have to have value creation for us. We're flushed with greenfield opportunities right now, very focused on executing all of the announced projects and pursuing new greenfield projects. And so we're looking and we're aware of it and open to it, but it has to deliver at the end of the day, the value that we expect. Your line is open. So I mean, we're really pleased with what we announced on AGS. And again, just to put it into context, between what we announced today and what we announced, I believe, late last year, we're growing that system 35% over the next year or two. And AGS is also directly connected to our Stonewall pipeline, which again, we announced previously a new firm contract on Stonewall. The -- as you -- I think as you know, one of our major customers on stonewalls Antero. And as David talked about, we've got over 60% of our growth capital committed. And so again, as the commercial team continues to firm up our growth capital, then we'll reassess what do we want to do with the rest of that Term Loan B. And from a capital structure, perspective, yes, we're very comfortable with the overall debt levels that we have because as we've talked about our growth capital aligned with the opportunity we have, that fits inside of our free cash flow. Your line is open. Just wondering with the takeaway constraints out of Appalachia, we've seen a number of Permian pipes announced some compression expansion. And yes, that's certainly one opportunity that we're actively pursuing whether compression expansion is viable. There's a couple other techniques, I'll say it that way, that we're looking at on NEXUS to enable incremental capacity at very modest incremental capital. NEXUS is a brand-new asset, very well connected to the downstream markets. And we're working both the NEXUS side, and like I alluded to earlier, the Stonewall side. So we're going to both ends, looking for any optimizations that we can do with these assets to eke out more incremental capacity. Any sense for the magnitude of how much capacity could be added via, I guess, compression or these other techniques either NEXUS or NEXUS plus Stonewall. Just given the point of the conversations right now on NEXUS, I'm going to -- I'm just not -- I'm not in a position to share that publicly right now on NEXUS. Because I think we've talked about it in the past, Stonewall is a 36-inch pipe that is -- has no compression on it. And then we can take that comfortably up to 2 Bcf a day, probably a little beyond under the right operating circumstances. So again, I think this is where we're looking at how do we do rational low-risk, low-cost expansions to help these producers monetize some of their acreage. And obviously, for Stonewall, we have to work in conjunction with our other pipeline rather in the industry to get beyond the southern end of stone walling further into the load centers. And again, there's a lot of activity going on, on AGS right now. And again, I'd just bear with me here, we'll -- we will provide that information. And on CCS, again, I'm going to refer back to that disciplined development approach that we always like to take. And again, as soon as we're comfortable sharing that with you, we will. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call."
