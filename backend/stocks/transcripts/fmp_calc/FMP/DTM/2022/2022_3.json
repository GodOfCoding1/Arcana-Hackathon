    "content": " With our strong year-to-date business performance and confidence in the balance of the year, we are increasing our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $810 million to $825 million which also includes the fourth quarter uplift of the Millennium Pipeline acquisition. We look forward to providing a complete update of our 2023 guidance on our year-end call, which will include a refreshed view for our base business and our long-term growth capital plan. And maybe I was hoping you can kind of talk about the decision to buy the Millennium stake as opposed to maybe deploying capital in areas that might have a little bit more growth like the Haynesville, was this just more about, it's an asset you knew you're building scale with a pretty high-quality contract base. And I think we alluded to that a little bit on the -- at least I did on the second quarter call on one of my comments is that we're always looking at ways to number one, reduce the CapEx on new projects or defer the outlay of the capital, which enhances returns on those projects."
