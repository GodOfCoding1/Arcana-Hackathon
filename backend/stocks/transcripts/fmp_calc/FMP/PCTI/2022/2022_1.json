    "content": " As you may have seen in our press release issued after market close, we achieved 27% growth year-over-year in revenue from 17.7 million in the first quarter 2021 to 22.5 million in 2022 which includes 2.6 million contributions from Smarteq wireless an acquisition that close in April 2021. We remain profitable with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02 in the quarter better by $0.01 compared to the same period in 2021 despite the product mix being more heavily weighted towards antenna sales, and the increased costs of freight, logistics and raw materials. Total revenues of 22.5 million were approximately 27% higher in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 because of higher revenues for antennas and industrial IoT devices. Revenues for antennas and industrial IoT devices were 17.1 million, an increase of 5.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. The first quarter of 2022 gross profit margin on a non-GAAP basis was 41.8%, which was 5.7% lower than the first quarter of 2021. The non-GAAP gross profit margin percentage for antennas and IoT devices was lower by 1.3% in the first quarter 2022 compared to the first quarter 2021 is less favorable product mix and higher costs for logistics and other components offset favorable operating leverage. EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was approximately 5% in the first quarter of 2022 the same as the first quarter of 2021 and non-GAAP, diluted earnings per share was $0.02 in the first quarter of 2022 higher by $0.01 compared to the first quarter of 2021."
