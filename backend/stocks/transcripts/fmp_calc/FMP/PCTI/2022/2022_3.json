    "content": " Total revenues were $26 million at the midpoint of our guidance range and were approximately 16% higher in the third quarter 2022 compared to the third quarter 2021, primarily due to higher volumes in both of our product lines. Revenues for antennas and Industrial IoT devices were $18.7 million in the period, an increase of $2 million compared to the third quarter 2021, driven by strong sales in our agriculture and utilities end markets. Test and Measurement revenues were $7.7 million for the third quarter 2022, $1.8 million higher compared to the third quarter 2021, primarily due to stronger sales for 5G products through OEM customers. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for antennas and Industrial IoT devices in the third quarter 2022 improved by 3.1% sequentially and by 0.6% compared to the third quarter 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact of lower freight costs, resulting from the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proactive mitigating actions, as previously mentioned, and operating leverage. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to provide an update on how we are progressing against our 3 growth strategies which we mentioned earlier, including launching innovative wireless products; expanding and leveraging distribution channels; and increasing market share by providing more components of the overall systems."
