    "content": " Revenues for antennas and industrial IoT devices were $16.4 million in the period, a decrease of roughly 14% or $2.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, negatively impacted by higher customer inventory levels. Test & Measurement revenue was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, 37.7% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to stronger sales for 5G products in the U.S. We delivered an all-time record revenue quarter for our Test & Measurement business and ended fiscal 2022 with a strong backlog for 2023. Fourth quarter 2022 gross margin -- gross profit margin on a non-GAAP basis was 50.6%, which exceeded our expectations and represents an increase of 400 basis points over the year-ago period. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for antennas and industrial IoT devices improved by 170 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 36.2%, primarily because of lower freight costs. Revenue for antennas and industrial IoT devices was $69.7 million in the period, an increase of roughly 10.5% compared to fiscal 2021 driven by persistent strength in the infrastructure, agriculture and automotive market segments. We achieved record Test & Measurement revenues of $30.6 million for fiscal 2022, 18.9% higher compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to stronger sales for 5G products to OEM customers. Non-GAAP gross profit margin for antennas and industrial IoT devices in fiscal 2022 was 33.8%, a 60 basis point decrease from fiscal 2021."
