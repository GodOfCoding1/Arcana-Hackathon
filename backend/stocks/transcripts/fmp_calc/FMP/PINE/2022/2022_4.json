    "content": " In total, during the fourth quarter, we acquired seven properties for just under$ 42 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.4%, and a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.2 years. For the full year 2022, we acquired 51 retail net lease properties for just over $187 million at a weighted average going in cap rate of 7.1%, and a weighted average remaining lease term at acquisition of 8.7 years. This is resulting in cap rates either holding from where they were a few months ago, which is in spite of the higher interest rates, or in the case of investment grade-rated tenants and smaller price point assets, we're starting to see cap rates compress because those assets are more easily financed at better terms, offer a hedge against continued inflation, and provide solid risk adjusted returns in a relatively volatile macroeconomic environment. Year-to-date, we've sold 16 properties for approximately $155 million at a weighted average exit cap rate of 6.5%, or 5.9% when removing the impact of our last remaining office property we sold during the second quarter. We enter 2023 with 54% of our total annualized base rents coming from tenants or the parent of a tenant with investment grade credit rating, which we anticipate will grow throughout the year as we continue to recycle out of non-investment grade-rated tenants and into high quality industry-leading retailers with balance sheets positioned to outperform in nearly any economic environment. Our 2023 guidance for acquisition activity is $100 million to $150 million of retail net lease properties, which is subject to reasonable market conditions, and we believe these acquisitions will occur at a similar or better blended yield to our 2022 full year acquisition cap rate. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning, guys."
