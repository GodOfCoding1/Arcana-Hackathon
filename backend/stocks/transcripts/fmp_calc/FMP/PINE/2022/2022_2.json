    "content": " Year-to-date, we've acquired 35 net lease properties for $109 million at a weighted average going in cash cap rate of 6.9% in a weighted average remaining lease term at acquisition of 9.4 years. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we sold our scrobbles carwash in Jacksonville, Florida for a 4.8% cap rate and we have invested the remaining disposition proceeds that were on our balance sheet in the form of 1031 restricted cash into a property lease to Lowe's. For the second quarter of 2022, the company paid a cash dividend of $0.27 per share, representing an 8% year-over-year increase over the company's Q2 2021 cash dividend and a current annualized yield of approximately 6%. We now expect to acquire between $215 million and $235 million of retail net leased properties during 2022, which is subject to market conditions and for which we still believe acquisitions will occur at a similar or better blended yield than our 2021 full year acquisition cap rates. Yes, I mean, they're, it's been amazing, we thought maybe we'd see a little bit more expansion on the cap rates, but on the smaller property sales, you're really seeing a lot of high net worth in and some institutional investors, buying these properties at Cap rates that really haven't changed too much from six months ago, so, so we're still seeing a good opportunity to recycle here. Yes, so Rob, I think it's, it's, again, a little bit of a barbell, we'll definitely do more of the Lowe's type transactions, where we see that opportunity, but we're not we're not bashful about buying something that's a really junky credit, if the property is a terrific property as far as alternatives, and it's a below market lease rate. And if, if we're assuming which we've said that there's going to be a slowdown in the back half of the year and an expansion of cap rates, we want to get those dispositions done sooner."
