    "content": " Obviously, the largest change to our top tenant list the removal of Wells Fargo, when combined with our Hilton office property sales in the fourth quarter in our office dispositions generated more than $16 million of gains, which reverse exchange into our Houston ground lease portfolio and the first quarter Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy portfolio. In consideration of our Q1 performance in the current capital markets backdrop, we did increase full year guidance to account for a lower weighted average share count for the year, increased acquisition and disposition guidance expectations for increasing near term and long-term interest rates as well as revisions to a number of other influential assumptions. On the transaction front, we now expect to acquire between $215 million and $250 million of retail net leased properties during 2022, which is a 7.5% increase to the bottom end of our range and subject to other market conditions which we believe these acquisitions will occur at similar or better blended yields to our current 2021 full year acquisition cap rate. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning, guys."
