    "content": " We are pleased to continue our positive momentum during the third quarter, with solid growth in net sales and adjusted EBITDA despite the strong comparable growth and outsized gains in gross margin that we achieved in the second half of last year. Gross profit increased 14%, and our gross margin declined 120 basis points to a very healthy 35.2%, as we did not repeat the exceptional gains from last year when prices were rising rapidly. Organic daily sales increased by 12% in the quarter driven by price inflation, resulting from product cost increases from our suppliers, partially offset by lower volume resulting from higher prices and softening economic conditions. Organic daily sales for landscaping products, which includes irrigation, nursery, hardscape, outdoor lighting and landscape accessories, increased 15% for the third quarter due to price inflation as prices for products like PVC pipe and drainage remain elevated compared to the prior year. Organic daily sales for agronomic products, which includes fertilizer, control products, ice melt and equipment, increased 5% for the third quarter due to price inflation resulting from rising product costs, partially offset by reduced volumes from higher prices. And as you know, our gross margin -- we expected kind of a reset of gross margin in \u00e2\u0080\u009822, and we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really realize that based on a really strong first half of this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing gross margins now that are lower than last year."
