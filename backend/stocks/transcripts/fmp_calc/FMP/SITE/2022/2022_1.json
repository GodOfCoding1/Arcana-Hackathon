    "content": " The combination of strong organic sales, excellent gross margin improvement and good contribution from acquisitions allowed us to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth of 97% for the quarter, and expand adjusted EBITDA margin by 310 basis points to 8.4%, a terrific start to 2022. On the acquisition front, we added three high performing companies to our family so far this year, all of which provide us with excellent new talent and capability for growth in their respective markets, while adding approximately $50 million in trailing 12-month sales to SiteOne. We were pleased with our organic daily sales growth this quarter given the 32% comp from the prior year, and to the slow start to the spring due colder and wetter weather in northern markets. Organic daily sales for landscaping products, which includes irrigation, nursery, hardscape, outdoor lighting and landscape accessories, increased 20% for the quarter due to price inflation and strong demand from both the new construction and repair and remodel end markets. As disclosed on our Q4 2021 earnings call, we expect a modest gross margin reduction in 2022 as our gross margin improvement initiatives, such as private label and small customer growth are more than offset by the loss of the price realization benefit that we experienced in the second half of last year.
