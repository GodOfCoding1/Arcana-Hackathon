    "content": " Overall, our adjusted operating margin decreased to 12% in Q2 of fiscal '22, from 13% in Q2 of fiscal '21, driven by the previously discussed factors related to gross margin, increased investment in R&D, and the reduction in revenues in our healthcare division, which tend to carry higher margins. Similarly, our security division's adjusted operating margin decreased to 14.2% in Q2 this year from 15.7% in Q2 of the last fiscal year, primarily due to a less favorable mix of customer revenues and rising costs in the supply chain. Larry, this is Alan. So I think you really have pointed out some of the reasons why the operating margins dropped for security in the Second Quarter, but as we move forward into the Q3 and Q4 on the stronger revenues the economies of scale associated with that, we are expecting operating margin expansion in security through the balance of the fiscal year. Larry, this is Alan."
