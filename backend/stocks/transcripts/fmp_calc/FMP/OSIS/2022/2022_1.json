    "content": " Moving to the Optoelectronic and Manufacturing division, Opto again delivered strong results with record Q1 revenues representing growth exceeding 15% over the prior year and maintain double digit adjusted operating margins, which is impressive given that we faced supply chain shortages and cost increases in this pandemic environment. Stronger revenue growth in our Opto division which inherently carries a lower gross margin than our other 2 divisions, places downward pressure on the consolidated gross margin, the mix of products and sales within the security and Opto divisions were also less favorable than the prior year's comparable quarter. Overall, our adjusted operating margin decreased to 10.9% in Q1 of fiscal \u201822, from 11.3% in Q1 of last year, driven by the previously discussed factors related to the gross margin, increased investment in research and development and the previously discussed changes in healthcare. We were pleased with the increase in the adjusted operating margin in our Security Division, which expanded to a record 16.2% in Q1 this year, as compared to 14.8% in the prior year first quarter. The variance was driven by economies of scale associated with a higher level of sales in the prior year towards the beginning of the pandemic that boosted the fiscal \u201821 margin, as well as increased R&D in the fiscal \u201822 first quarter to support new product development, higher component costs in this challenging supply chain environment and increased investments in infrastructure to support future growth that put downward pressure on the fiscal \u201822 margin for healthcare. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
