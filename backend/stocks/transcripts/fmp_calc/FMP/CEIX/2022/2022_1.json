    "content": " The Pennsylvania Mining Complex shipped 6.5 million tons from its four available longwalls in Q1 of '22, and achieved the highest quarterly average coal revenue per ton sold since becoming an independent public company in 2017. Despite lower throughput volumes, terminal revenue for the quarter came in at $21.4 million, a significant increase over $18.2 million in Q1 of '21, as the throughput rate per ton was substantially improved due to increased export demand and commodity pricing strength. As such, we sold 6.5 million tons at an average realized coal revenue per ton of $59.60 in Q1 '22, compared to 6.9 million tons at $41.39 in the year ago period. Domestically, Henry Hub natural gas spot prices averaged $4.67 per million Btu, and PJM West day-ahead power prices averaged $56 per megawatt hour in the quarter, which are some of the highest quarterly levels we've seen since becoming a standalone public company. In the first quarter of '22, we recorded an additional $102 million of unrealized mark-to-market loss on commodity derivatives associated with our remaining API2 hedges for the balance of '22, as well as $86 million in losses on the settlement of API2 hedges that concluded during the quarter. For the PAMC, we are pleased to announce that due to a strong 1Q '22 performance and improved outlook, we are raising our expected average realized coal revenue guidance to a range of $58 to $61 per ton, net of settlements of commodity derivatives. 16:25 Additionally for the PAMC, we are reaffirming our 2022 sales volume range of 23 million to 25 million tons, as the operations ran very well in the first quarter, and transportation bottlenecks have gradually improved since the end of 2021."
