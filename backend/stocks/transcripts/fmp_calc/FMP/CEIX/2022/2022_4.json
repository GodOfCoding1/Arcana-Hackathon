    "content": " First, our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to meaningfully accelerate progress toward our debt reduction goal and we made debt payments of nearly $300 million in 2022. We sold 6.2 million tons of PAMC coal at an average realized coal revenue per ton sold of $75.92 in Q4 of '22, compared to 5.6 million tons at $51.27 in the year-ago period. Henry Hub natural gas spot prices averaged $5.55 per million BTU in Q4 '22, a 17% increase compared to the prior-year period. During 4Q '22, we generated $116 million of free cash flow, 70% of which was deployed towards continuing to reduce our gross debt levels. In fact, since CEIX went public, we have reduced our net debt by 86% or $647 million which translates to more than $18 per share of equity value creation based on our current shares outstanding. Since yearend, we reduced our gross debt by an additional $50 million by making discretionary payments in January 2023 of $25 million each towards to our Term Loan B and Second Lien Notes that were not included in our fourth quarter results. This morning, we reported a strong fourth quarter '22 financial performance with net income of $193 million or $5.39 per diluted share, by far our highest quarterly earnings per share levels since becoming an independent public company in 2017. On the pricing front, we expect our average realized core revenue per ton to be in the $78 to $84 range relative to 2022 levels, this range reflect our strong contracted position and allows for upward or downward movement in API to PJM invest power prices, as well as the potential to further optimize our sales portfolio. As promised, we increased our shareholder return percentage due to our expectations of achieving our $300 million gross debt goal this quarter."
