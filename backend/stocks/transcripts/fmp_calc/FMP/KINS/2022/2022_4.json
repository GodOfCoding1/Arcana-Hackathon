    "content": " We like others were unprepared for the sudden spike in inflation during late \u00e2\u0080\u009821 and early 2022, while our rates anticipated a far lower rate than we actually experienced, and while I hope that we have seen peak inflation and are on a declining path, know this that our rate levels are reflective of this difficult environment and we will continue to appropriately adjust them to address ongoing inflation. As we've all seen with the rapid onset of inflation came higher interest rates, since Kingstone's investment portfolio comprises fixed income securities, the rising rate environment has had a material impact on their valuation. Beyond the macro factors discussed, the primary driver of our fourth quarter and calendar year 2022 underwriting loss has been the results of our businesses in States other than New York, namely New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Our four pillar strategy for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824, which we've creatively coined Kingstone 3.0 is focused on four things: one, aggressively reducing the non-New York book of business; two, adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends including inflation; three, tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs; and last, continuing our focus on expense reduction. But I'd like as to think about maybe taken those -- taken that out in this report and the numbers straight up, you know, you guys were in New York, so we're going to Winter Storms and Hurricanes and just kind of, in my opinion, it's part of doing business, I'm from South Alabama."
