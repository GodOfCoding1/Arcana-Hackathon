    "content": " We fully expect that our A+ rated portfolio will pay off at par upon maturity, and the decline in other comprehensive income will be restored at the time, as rates have already begun to return and now are back to early Q2 levels, book value per share suffered by $0.57 in the second quarter and $1.30 year-to-date. So the small single-digit, I think it was 3% growth in PIF account this quarter is the net of new business ads that are far better priced and underwritten, and the elimination of those risks that we're targeting, you know, that we're targeting, getting away from."
