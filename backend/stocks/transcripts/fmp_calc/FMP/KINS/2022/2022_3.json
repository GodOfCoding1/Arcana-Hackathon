    "content": " Total new business premium is up about 9%, driven by an increase in average new business premium per policy of 8%, that is it's 8% higher than the average premium than we generated in 2021 from the legacy product. Before I turn the call over to Meryl, I want to reiterate three things: one, our Board is open to all options to enhance stockholder value; two, we are not sitting still and are taking every action to best position Kingstone for the future, including with respect to the upcoming refinancing; and three, we are optimistic that the changes we have invested in through our recently completed Kingstone 2.0 will result in our return to profitability."
