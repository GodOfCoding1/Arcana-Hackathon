    "content": " I'm proud to share the results from fiscal year 2022, where we not only met our revenue guidance by delivering a record $37.2 million in top line, but we also closed Q4 with $11.5 million in revenue, making it the highest revenue-generating quarter and year for the company to date. This represents decrease from our December 31, 2021 cash position of $37.6 million, primarily attributed to roughly to $16 million cash paid for acquisition of JustCBD, as well as higher operating expenses related to sales and marketing of acquired businesses, one-off cash expenses and M&A-related charges. But if we did, based on a mathematical difference based on previously provided IFRS results and full year results, we've definitely seen some reduction in gross profit in 4Q, which was impacted by year-end adjustments as well as the year-end sales campaigns and discounts, which are primarily driven by our House of Brands division, which resulted in a lower adjusted EBITDA compared to - for full year. And we expect that there will be not significant outflows on CapEx this year, but we're going to continue to invest from a working capital standpoint on inventory that we know is turning incredibly fast, like the one that Jessie mentioned in our House of Brands product like our plus line that is working really well, our vape line that is working really well. Growth in harvest  cannabis implies production capacity and efficiency and cannabis cultivation base improved in '22, contributing to a more robust inventory position, more robust position also indicates a remarkable change in inventory data, substantial increase in finished goods, gross also indicative of higher demand for our products, as well as strategic decision to maintain a larger inventory to quickly fulfill our customer data, customer orders, as well as capitalize on market opportunities."
