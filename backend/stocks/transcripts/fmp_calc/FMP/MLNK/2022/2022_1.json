    "content": " As a result, MeridianLink exceeded guidance again in Q1, with GAAP revenue up 7% year-over-year to $72.8 million and 47% adjusted EBITDA margins. Specifically, 7% of our lending software solution revenues and 70% of our data verification software solutions revenues were tied to our mortgage-focused products in the first quarter. We have no doubt that we will continue adding new clients, providing more value to our customers and therefore, increasing revenue for MeridianLink as a whole, and our guidance for the year reflects the ongoing strength of the non-mortgage solutions we provide, which grew 17% year over year in our most recent quarter."
