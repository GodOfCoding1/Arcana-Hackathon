    "content": " MeridianLink exceeded guidance in Q4, with GAAP revenue up 10% year-over-year to $70.6 million and 33% adjusted EBITDA margins. We generated total revenue of $70.6 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in our consumer lending transaction volumes, increased product bill lives and the acquisition of Open Close. For the full year 2022, we generated total revenue of $288 million, up 8% year-over-year, while we absorbed a $15 million headwind related to mortgage we still grew the business by $20 million, a great example of proper execution in the face of an unpredictable rate environment. Pairing this with the slight improvement on runrate volumes we've seen, we're expecting growth year-over-year of the mortgage-related lending revenue, excluding Open Close, which continues to contribute around $1 million per month. I'd say from about quarter-over-quarter or even year-over-year perspective, it's been fairly consistent on the established players and where it has changed is over the last three years when money was cheaper, and we saw heavy investments in startups, we're starting to see a lot of competition point solution perspective, I'm seeing less and less of that as those organizations look to right size their business and conserve cash flow and avoid down roads."
