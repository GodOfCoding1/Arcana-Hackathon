    "content": " We see opportunities in current conditions given that deposit taking financial institutions have higher net interest margin today, we expect demand for our consumer lending business to remain strong as customers and prospects seek ways to more effectively engage with their customers across the entire array of loan types. In particular services revenue hit a new high watermark as software projects delivered in the quarter were 50% higher than in Q1 of this year, and we delivered an integration with MX Technologies to provide for a more highly automated account opening process as our customers continue to see strong new account growth. As for third quarter results, we generated total revenue of $71.8 million, up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased consumer lending transaction volumes and product go-lives. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some nuances between those two that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring together that will add more value to our customers, and being more specific over the short term, we plan to leverage OpenClose is point-of-sale and configurable point-of-sale for all of the customer base as well as for on the MeridianLink Mortgage side, we have a great position from a competitive perspective on our pricing and packaging engine to serve the broader market."
