    "content": " We delivered software revenue growth of 88% year-over-year to 3 million in Q1, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range, as we\u2019re experiencing shortened timelines between hardware sales and the initiation of software agreements. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so our implied full year guidance on the hardware side has a bit more range given that we want to be flexible in meeting the needs of our customers and given that it\u2019s still relatively early in the rollout of second and third party products that work with LatchOS, we\u2019re not breaking out specific revenue there but we did say in our prepared remarks that we derived over a million dollars in hardware and associated software revenue from second and third party product in the first quarter. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And I think, to echo what you said, historically, these types of products have continued to do well, even in recessionary environments and so we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that if the North American market was to enter more of a recession type territory, that the macro trends, which are a dramatic shortage of housing, the need for new multifamily units, the need to outfit buildings to make them more efficient, better places to live, will continue to work to our advantage, and the needs for our products will persist and perhaps even increase in some instances."
