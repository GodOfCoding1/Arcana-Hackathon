    "content": " In 2022, we expect the Coal Mining segment\u2019s operating profit to decrease significantly from 2021, both including and excluding the contract termination fees from Bisti last year and GRE this year. We expect results at our consolidated mining operations to decrease significantly, primarily due to substantially lower earnings at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, driven by an anticipated reduction in customer demand predominantly in the second half of the year from higher than average levels in 2021. Segment EBITDA for the Coal Mining segment, which excludes the termination payments of $10.3 million received from Bisti Fuels\u2019 customer in 2021 and the $14 million contract termination fee from GRE received this week, is expected to decrease significantly in 2022 from last year, primarily as a result of the forecasted reduction in operating profit partly offset by an increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. At North American Mining, we expect full year 2022 operating profit to increase over last year, primarily in the fourth quarter due to an anticipated increase in customer requirements and contributions from contracts executed during 2021. Moving to Minerals Management, we expect operating profit and segment EBITDA to increase significantly over last year, primarily driven by current expectations for natural gas and oil prices for the remainder of this year, partly offset by an anticipated reduction in production."
