    "content": " Finally, third quarter 2022 operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA in the Minerals Management segment increased as a result of higher natural gas and oil prices and increased production. Coal Mining operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA for the 2023 full year are expected to decrease significantly compared with 2022, including and excluding the $14 million GRE termination payment received this year. We anticipate North American Mining segment adjusted EBITDA for the 2022 full year to increase significantly compared with the prior year, including and excluding the third quarter voluntary retirement charge. In 2023, North American Mining's full year operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA due to increased results from active mining operations and an expected reduction in operating expenses in part due to a reduction in employee-related costs resulting from the voluntary retirement program. Finally, at our Minerals Management segment, we anticipate operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA in both the 2022 fourth quarter and full year to continue to increase significantly over the respective prior year periods primarily driven by current expectations for natural gas and oil prices and increases in production volumes. Conversely, in 2023, operating profit and segment adjusted EBITDA are expected to decrease from this year, primarily driven by current market expectations for natural gas and oil prices and anticipated reduction in volumes as existing wells follow their natural production decline and limited forecasted development of additional new wells by third-party lessees."
