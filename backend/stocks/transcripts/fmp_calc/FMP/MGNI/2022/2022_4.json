    "content": " Some examples of recent customer wins include Bud Speed, who is in the early stages of onboarding Demand Manager; the Arena Group, a tech-powered media company, which includes premier pubs, such as Sports Illustrated, The Street, Men's Journal and Prad, has chosen Magnet as its preferred PMP partner; and Trusted Media brands, which reaches more than 200 million consumers worldwide across every screen, selected Magnite's Demand Manager solution and has seen approximately an 8% CPM lift when using Demand Manager. As supply path where SPO accelerates, Magnite stands to gain in several ways: first, as a recipient of additional ad spend when competitive platforms go offline; second, as sellers migrate to the partner that's most differentiated, indispensable and likely to bolster their bottom lines; and third, as buyers consolidate spend on a select list of SSPs that meet all of their complex criteria."
