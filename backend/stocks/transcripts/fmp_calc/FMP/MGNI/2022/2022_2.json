This is very much an auction where they know who are the participants are, and the participants know what the price floors are, and utilizing that against the mixture of upfront direct sold yields the highest amount of CPM, and so what I think you're going to see is this expansion of biddable inventory in the top tier, most of it will be through the form of invite only auction but that's good news for a player like Magnite because it has to run through someone who can conduct an auction, and that's what kind of what we're good at."
