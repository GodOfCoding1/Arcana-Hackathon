    "content": " We generated broad-based growth across a wide range of end markets, resulting in a consolidated Q2 revenue increase of 21%, to $50.4 million, a second quarter record for Transcat. Service gross margin expanded 70 basis points from prior year and hit a second quarter record of 32.9% as we leveraged our fixed costs from the high level of organic growth, and our technician productivity remains strong. It should be noted that both consolidated and Service segment operating income were impacted by approximately $800,000 of onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of NEXA, including a 1% Irish stamp tax on the full purchase price of the acquisition as is customary, when acquiring businesses based in Ireland. Once this backlog is fully amortized after 5 months, we would expect NEXA's higher level of profitability to add approximately 100 basis points to our Service segment's gross margin profile, on a go-forward basis. Looking forward to Distribution, while we're not immune to the supply chain constraints, impacting most companies, the business has certainly improved over prior year, and we expect that to continue, going forward, and to achieve low-teens revenue growth in the third quarter.
