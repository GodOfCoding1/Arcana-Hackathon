    "content": " Consolidated revenue increased 16% to $50.9 million, a third quarter record for Transcat, and consolidated gross margin expanded 130 basis points at 26.8%. In addition to strong service revenues in the third quarter, we expanded our Service gross margin 180 basis points to 29.7%. Still Incoming orders in the third quarter were strong, and we enter our fiscal fourth quarter in a solid position with a record $9 million in backlog up $3.3 million from the prior year. Turning to Slide 5, our consolidated gross profit of $13.6 million, was up 21% from prior year and our gross margin expanded a 130 basis points to 26.8%. As we discussed last quarter, per purchase accounting rules, we are amortizing the acquired backlog of approximately $500,000 over the first five months post-acquisition, which reduces revenue and therefore gross profit and operating income. Year-to-date CapEx through the end of the third quarter was $5.9 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year, and continued to be centered around Service segment capabilities, technology, including automation and future growth projects."
