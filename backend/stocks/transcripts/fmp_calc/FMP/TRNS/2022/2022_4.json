    "content": " In the fourth quarter, we generated 20% revenue growth and 8% organic service growth as demand in a highly regulated end markets remain strong. Finally, on a full-year basis, total consolidated revenue was $205 million, an increase of over 18% compared to the prior fiscal year, which represents a new record high for Transcat. Our service business grew over 20% for the full-year and importantly, we saw consistently strong demands throughout the year, as we reported 20% year-over-year growth in every quarter of fiscal 2022. Our full-year service gross margin hit a record high of 31.9%, which represents an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year and an impressive 660 basis point increase from fiscal year 2020. Q4 net income of $3 million decreased 5% from prior year and our diluted earnings per share came in at $0.40, but both net income and earnings per share were negatively impacted by increased acquisition accounting costs as well as a modestly higher tax rate compared to the prior year."
