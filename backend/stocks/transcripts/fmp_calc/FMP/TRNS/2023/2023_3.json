    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA, a very important metric for us given our level of acquisitive growth, as I just mentioned, grew 20% from the prior year third quarter to $6.6 million. Please proceed with your question. You saw a nice acceleration, they were up 12% on an organic basis and I'm curious if you can maybe pinpoint, I don't know, areas of outperformance relative to prior quarters, whether that's end market standpoint, maybe its increased synergy contribution from NEXA and other that's lapped a year plus. As far as the CBLs, the two or three that we has sort of mentioned and guided towards in the beginning of the year, they take a couple of quarters to normalize and during that period of time when you land several in one quarter, there's a bit of a drag and that drag did exist and we're probably -- we'll probably see ourselves coming out of that a little bit more in the fourth quarter and as we enter the first quarter. We're not going to guide towards exactly what the number of associated sort of basis points would be, but it's a typical two to three quarter drag and you should see us starting to come out of the ones at least that we landed in the first quarter as we close out the year. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
