    "content": " Net revenue for the quarter in the July 3, 2022 was $223.2 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range up 6% sequentially and down 27.7% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with a non-GAAP operating loss of $4.2 million, and non-GAAP operating margin of negative 1.9%. We began our efforts to optimize spend on the CHP side of the business in the second quarter by deemphasizing investment in areas that are declining, and in conjunction with stronger SMB performance, we were able to improve non-GAAP operating margins by 250 basis points as compared to the prior quarter. For the second quarter of 2022, net revenue for the Americas was $144 million, a decline of 32.3% year-over-year, and relatively flat on a sequential basis. EMEA, net revenue was $45 million, which is down 27.2% year-over-year, and up 21.9% quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 27.7%, which is down 270 basis points as compared to 30.4% in the prior year comparable period, and down 50 basis points compared to 28.2% in the first quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter was 9.5% of net revenue as compared to 6.9% of net revenue in the prior year comparable period, and 10.8% of net revenue in the first quarter of 2022. The Connected Home segment, which includes our industry-leading Orbi, Nighthawk, Nighthawk Pro Gaming and Meural brands generated net revenue of $128.9 million during the quarter, which is down 43.9% on a year-over-year basis and down 1.1% sequentially. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to share that the SMB generated record net revenue of $94.4 million for the second quarter of 2022, which is up 19.5% on a year-over-year basis and up 17.6% sequentially. Last but not least on the services side, revenue was $8 million for the second quarter up 4% sequentially and up to 26% year-over-year."
