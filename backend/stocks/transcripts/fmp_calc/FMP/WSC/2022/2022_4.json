    "content": "  Outperformance from continuing operations resulted in full year 2022 return on invested capital of 15% as well as revenue of $2.14 billion, up 28%; net income of $276 million, up 141%; and adjusted EBITDA of $884 million, up 36% year-over-year, respectively. Net debt to EBITDA has dropped to 3.1x pro forma for the U.K. divestiture, which is at the low end of our target range and the lowest level in the last 10 years, all while supporting the strongest reinvestment in the history of our business with $414 million of net CapEx, $221 million invested in 13 acquisitions and over $750 million of share repurchases, which reduced our economic share count by 8.2%."
