    "content": " Before we begin, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, including potential time lines for our ongoing clinical trials, and FDA submissions and approvals and expected market size for these products. Furthermore, I'm excited to share that we are well on our way towards the formation of an exceptional Scientific Advisory Board, charged with providing both external expert and clinical perspective and high-level counsel on the company's micronized dHACM injectable pipeline in Knee OA, as well as other indications in musculoskeletal disease and in sports medicine. As Tim mentioned, following the end of the FDA's period of enforcement discretion on May 31, 2021, we faced a 13% shortfall as our Section 351 products came off the market in the U.S. With this quarter's strong top line performance in our continuing portfolio, we have essentially closed that gap. Looking ahead, on a full year basis in 2022, we continue to expect 11% to 14% growth in our continuing portfolio of products, which totaled $240 million of net sales in 2021. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. First of all, let me say that when you think about MiMedx, the Wound Care and Surgical recovery group has a dedicated team that's focused on developing 361 products and 510(k)."
