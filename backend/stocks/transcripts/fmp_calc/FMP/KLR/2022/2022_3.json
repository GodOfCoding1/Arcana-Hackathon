    "content": " Overall, our third quarter revenue was $83.9 million, in line with our previously provided outlook despite the adverse effect of foreign exchange rates, largely due to short-term headwinds driven by heightened connectivity costs, our gross profit decreases slightly impacting our adjusted gross margin of 21.5% for the third quarter. As Dario noted, our total revenue in the third quarter was $83.9 million, a decrease of $109,000 from $84 million in the comparable year ago period. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance, decreased $793,000 or $0.02 $0.01 per basic and diluted share based on 44.7 million and 54.6 million weighted average shares outstanding respectively, from $3.6 million or $0.09 and $0.07 per basic and diluted share based on 41.6 million and 52.4 million weighted average share outstanding, respectively, in the comparable year-ago period. Kaleyra is no exception to this challenging environment and with the typical seasonality expected, we are anticipating our revenue fourth quarter to range between $86 million and $90 million, resulting in full year-over-year growth at 24% for 2022."
