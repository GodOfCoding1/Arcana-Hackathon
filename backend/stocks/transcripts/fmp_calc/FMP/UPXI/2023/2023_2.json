    "content": " For our most recent fiscal second quarter ending December 31, 2022 we exceeded internal expectations by generating record revenues of $27.1 million, an increase of 444% as compared to $4.9 million for the same adjusted period the prior year, and an increase of 134% as compared to $11.6 million sequentially. Revenue Growth was predominantly driven by strong yearend sales in many of our brands, including E-Core, Tytan Tiles, Vitamedica and Cygnet Online, as well as strong sales from our pet product business, LuckyTail. The three month and six month ended December 31, 2022 include the acquisitions of Cygnet Online, our Amazon aggregation business, LuckyTail, our pet product brand and E-Core our product distribution business which also includes Tytan Tiles. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 totaled $27.1 million, an increase of 444% as compared to the $4.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The company had net loss from operations of $2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a 16% improvement compared to the $2.5 million loss for the same period the prior year. Management expects revenues to continue to increase in calendar 2023, both organically, acquisitions completed during the 2022 fiscal year, as well as additional strategic acquisitions that align with management's long term growth strategies. Right now we're really comfortable with where we're at and really focused on, I think the next couple of quarters and really want to try to squeeze that business and produce the kind of margins that we think we can, to give everybody a look at how -- what we think are the potential."
