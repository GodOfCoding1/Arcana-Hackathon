    "content": " For our most recent fiscal quarter ending September 30, revenue totaled $11.6 million, an increase of 199% as compared to $3.9 million for the same period the year prior, predominantly driven by meaningful growth for our brands across most of our product categories and sales platforms. In late October, 2022, we announced a sale of these select CBD assets for approximately $23.5 million to streamline our business for more focus on high margin growth areas and dependable sales and profit visibility. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 totaled $11.6 million, an increase of 199% as compared to $3.9 million for the same period the prior year. Cost of revenue during the quarter totaled $5.5 million, an increase of 334% as compared to $1.3 million for the same period the prior year. This increase in operating expenses was primarily related to an increase in sales and marketing of $1 million, an increase in distribution costs, including the use of third-party distributors of $2.4 million, an increase in general and administrative costs of $900,000 to support the growth of the business, and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash expenses which were share-based compensation, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and depreciation. The main assets sold were originally acquired for approximately $6.3 million in cash and stock, company value increased through organic growth and valued partnerships."
