    "content": " For the full year 2022, as we take these additional personnel related actions, as well as exit and cease use of certain leased office space, we plan to record up to approximately $85 million in estimated pre-tax restructuring charges, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be inclusive of the $33 million pretax restructuring charge that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recorded year-to-date. And I think the rest of the year, in a way because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re assuming that this continues, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of thinking of it as a bit of a wash because I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be in a holding pattern until the market can get some more confidence about inflation peaking and, in turn, some certainty around the pace and trajectory of Fed rate increases. And the key to achieving our medium-term targets is going to be heavily influenced now not only by the macroeconomic outlook but also efforts around expense prudence and discipline and the issuance recovery pattern that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in 2023 and beyond as issuers return to the market to refinance those existing obligations, fund their working capital needs and really invest for growth. That implies, obviously, approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around 30% lower than the total incentive compensation we accrued for in 2021, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primarily driven by a downwardly revised outlook for rated issuance."
