The necessary facility expansions and new equipment to increase production capacity were in place by the end of 2022.  thing is that, just as this increased production capacity that's coming online, a production contamination event was detected by standard in-process quality control testing around the end of the third quarter of 2022. Due to the loss in earned gross margin as being incurred during the first quarter of 2023, we have made the decision to defer for the time being, completion of the incremental plan investments and increase our production capacity further to over $40 million per year. However, the other view is that we are approaching both $30 million in annual production capacity for First Defense with a flex auction to get to more than $40 million in the future, while at the same time, we were advancing to the final stages of a very significant FDA product development initiative. So we want to get ahead and get to that $40 million level, but I think it's prudent cash flow-wise and safe production wise to pause on that, settle, get back up and running at the $30 million and -- I still intend to put that program back in place, but it's not -- the start date is not that urgent."
