    "content": " Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements or the safe harbor statement provided with last night's press release and with our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and with the company's other periodic filings with the SEC. Again, product sales were up 46% during the first quarter of 2022 and up 45% for the 12 month period ended March 31, 2022 in comparison to the respective periods of the prior year. Prior to our introduction of the newest extension of the First Defense product line in late 2017, namely First Defense Tri-Shield annual production capacity of about $16.5 million was adequate to cover sales promptly without an order backlog. Given our sales of approximately $21.1 million during the 12 months ended March 31, 2022 with an order backlog outstanding as of March 31st, I feel confident that we made the right decision during the second quarter of 2021 to initiate an additional capital investment to further increase our annual production capacity to about $35 million by the end of this year, that work continues as planned. I think while it requires a little bit of patience to get into the -- although, we built the capacity -- production capacity of 10 million, I think trying to grab that through a mass market distribution launch in the first year or so, it's too risky."
