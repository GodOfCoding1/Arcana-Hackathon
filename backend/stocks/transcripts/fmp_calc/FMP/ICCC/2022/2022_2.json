    "content": " Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements better known as the Safe Harbor statement provided with last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release and with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the 3-month period ended June 30, 2022, along with the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other periodic filings with the SEC. EBITDA, which is an important non-GAAP financial measurement for us given the high level of non-cash depreciation expense that we carry, increased to $1.5 million during the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022 from $1.1 million during the 6-month period ended June 30, 2021. Net working capital increased to $14.8 million at June 30, 2022 from $13.7 million at December 31, 2021. Prior to our introduction of the newest extension of the First Defense product line in late 2017 namely Tri-Shield First Defense, annual production capacity of about $16.5 million was adequate to cover sales promptly without an order backlog. Project E and F which were initiated during 2021 are nearing completion for a combined cost of about $1.7 million, increasing our annual production capacity to about $30 million. We are working to complete Project G, which was also initiated during 2021 by year end to further increase our annual production capacity to about $35 million. Looking forward, I am really very excited about the value of our newest investment in what we call Project H to increase our annual production capacity above $40 million and provide optionality for further investment north of that."
