I think if you look back over the last several years, it runs somewhere in the 25% to 28% range depending on the year, as far as what we\u2019re paying to tax professionals for the dollar that they generate. I mean just given the success we had last year, bringing in so many incremental new clients from that first-time filer base and the fact, George, that we gained so much market share last year with some of those first-time filers will inevitably go back to the sidelines, even though we\u2019re doing everything we can to recruit and retain them to continue to file taxes. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may remember, Alex, I mean we used to be in the mid-30s from a tax perspective, and we have continued to run in these mid to high teens for the last several years, which we have just done a really awesome job of taking advantage of some tax planning and ultimately creating a lot of extra cash flow for the company. Obviously, releasing a reserve is not necessarily cash connected this time, but obviously, when we made those tax planning strategies several years ago, that\u2019s when we got that cash benefit at that time, so contemplating our full year outlook and still feel good about the 16% to 18%. We will have a clean year to report and we will have a nice baseline going forward versus if we hadn\u2019t made the fiscal year change, we would have had a tax season from last year rolling into May 17th, and would have been an unusual comparable."
