As a reminder, given that the tax season extended through July 15 last year versus only May 17 this year, our quarter ending September 30 is not comparable, and does not clearly depict our performance and progress as we're off to a great start. Since 2016 with average annual free cash flow of $465 million, an increase of 29% including the most recent quarter, we've grown the dividend by 35% and repurchased nearly a quarter of shares outstanding. Over the past 5 years, we've returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders, or approximately 84% of our total free cash flow. Going back to the top and small business, there's two things I would highlight number one last year, which was our first year, we grew assisted small business clients by about 4%."
