    "content": " We have grown total clients, grown Assisted market share, grown revenue and EBITDA more than 12% each and reduced shares outstanding by 21%, leading to adjusted EPS growth of nearly 50% and we've grown the dividend. When normalizing prior year results for the tax season impacts recognized in July of 2020, and the impacts of Emerald Card stimulus, total revenue increased by $165 million or 5%. Compared to the normalized prior year, adjusted earnings per share increased from $2.97 to $3.51 or 18%. Because of the momentum and strength in our business, we are pleased to further enhance our capital allocation by announcing another increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share or more than 7% growth, and a new share repurchase authorization of $1.25 billion which is effective through fiscal year 2025. So, all those pieces working together continued performance in small business tax, which we've seen over the last several years, all those pieces working together obviously driving the revenue side, and then leveraging our fixed cost structure, as we've talked about obviously, variable costs will go up."
