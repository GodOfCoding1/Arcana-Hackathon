    "content": " As Mike highlighted, we get another strong quarter with fourth quarter revenues of $253 million up 12% over the same period last year, and $3 million above the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range. Our operating income of $76 million, which increased 10% year over year, was 30% of revenue for the fourth quarter. A record level net income in the third -- in the fourth quarter was $78 million, or $1.57 per share, up 28% over the same period last year, and $0.17 above the high end of our previous guidance range of $1.25 per share to $1.40 per share. Despite this weakening environment, we remain confident in our thesis for outperformance, which includes backlog to support our lithography business doubling in revenue This year, novis Edge inspection increasing 50% to support EU wafer manufacturing, and we expect revenue from our power and compound semiconductor customers to grow. So, and as far as the -- what we're seeing, so that when we originally talked, we talked about a 20% down market, now we're looking at maybe a 30% down ex front end litho, so that looks to be where the market's leveling out. Well, I mean, if it's, if it's 10%, maybe we're going to grow another 50% better to 15% or 20% based on the, the fact that we're introducing new products into a broader portfolio or suite that seems to resonate with the customers and it's solving real, real problems for them. If I just look at your down 20% outlook for 2023, for the $1 billion base, it kind of feels like you're going to run rate at about $200 million for each of the 4 quarters."
