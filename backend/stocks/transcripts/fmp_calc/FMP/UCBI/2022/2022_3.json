    "content": " As Lynn mentioned, we had 38 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, 33 basis points of which came from the impact of higher rates and seven came from the positive mix change in the form of lower cash on the balance sheet and the higher loan to deposit ratio I mentioned earlier. I think from the rate changes that we've already made, it's -- you're at 10% for the fourth quarter. So we've been -- I don't think loan losses are going to be 3 basis points forever and it would seem that likely they would return to more normalized levels and, of course, that will play a role I think in the provisioning and the allowance going forward as much as anything else. Can you talk a little bit about the bond portfolio and sort of how you balance the aspect of that rate continue to move higher since 25% of it is variable, it would almost seem like the yield maybe on the bond book going forward would move up maybe more than what it would cost you to go out rate deposits. I think you are seeing deposits stabilize a bit, but it could be down again next quarter as there is a lot of competition out there from short term money market, institutional money market funds, short term bond funds, that kind of thing. So with the fourth quarter being a seasonally strong quarter and with the new strategy of not holding loans back, I would expect that SBA loan sale gain line to be about $0.5 million or maybe a little more higher in the fourth quarter."
