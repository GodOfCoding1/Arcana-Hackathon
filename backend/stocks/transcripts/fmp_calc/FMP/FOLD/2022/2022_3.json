    "content": " In the third quarter, our growth and key performance indicators are meeting our objectives in all geographies, and as S\u00c3\u00a9bastien will highlight, we continue to see strong trends in a number of our metrics, including new patient starts and in-person visits between our field team and our physicians, so we are reiterating our guidance of 15% to 20% growth in Galafold revenues at constant exchange rates. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that our monthly net patient trends continue to show positive signals; indeed, the three-month trend is the highest in the last two years, and if you look at the growth in net patients on Galafold globally, which is perhaps the truest measure of the underlying business, we see greater than 19% growth in patients on Galafold at the end of Q3 this year versus the same period last year, all indications of the continued and growing demand for Galafold. We ended the third quarter with over half of the global market share of treated amenable patients, and while the global mix remains about 55% switch and 45% na\u00c3\u00afve in many geographies, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a stronger uptake in na\u00c3\u00afve populations, so while we are achieving high market shares in countries where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been approved the longest, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of opportunity still to continue to switch patients over to Galafold and continue to grow the market as we penetrate into the diagnosed untreated as well as the newly diagnosed segments. On Slide 9, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far this year is that Galafold uptake continues to track very well and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing growth across all our major markets as well as most of our smaller markets while on track to achieve our full year revenue guidance of 15% to 20% growth at constant exchange rates. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. The other thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say is that as we look at the numbers and as you look at the metrics we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is really a continued building of momentum coming out of what was probably the depths of the COVID impact, and so as S\u00c3\u00a9bastien highlighted on the call, seeing the three-month net new patient numbers being the largest they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been for the last two years, I think that gives us great confidence that we are seeing resumed growth and momentum, which is so important for that key franchise. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. As it relates to the U.S., as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned, I think what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important about AT-GAA is we have a very differentiated data set, and if you look at a number of the market research polls and a number of the sell side research that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been published out there, I think you do see an alignment around the indicated--or sorry, the populations that were studied, and so some alignment around AT-GAA in the switch population and the other products in the na\u00c3\u00afve population, so I think that data set that Jeff highlighted on the call today is really the key for us, that we can show an improvement in patients who switch from enzyme replacement therapy on both six-minute walk and forced vital capacity, and we think those are the data that are really going to be compelling for physicians and look forward to having the opportunity to get out there and promote the product on the other side of an approval. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
