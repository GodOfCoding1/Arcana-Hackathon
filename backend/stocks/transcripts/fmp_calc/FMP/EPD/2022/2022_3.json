    "content": " Moving to CapEx, year-to-date growth CapEx excluding our Midland Basin acquisition totaled $973 million and our current expectation for growth capital for 2022 and 2023 remains in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Capital investments for the first nine months of 2022 were $4.4 billion, which included the $3.2 billion acquisition of Navitas Midstream, $973 million invested for organic growth capital projects and $234 million for sustaining capital expenditures. When we went into this year and at our analyst meeting, we said, given the momentum we have, we thought that year-end 2021 to year-end \u00e2\u0080\u009823 hard to call, which year it would land in, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be up to -- and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going with the oil, 1.5 million barrels of increase. So, I would tell you that I think we are probably an increase -- and that puts us year-to-date increase of between 350,000 third-party 400,000 barrels, depending on which numbers you look at. Josh, this is Randy. Josh, this is Randy."
