    "content": " Together with our buybacks for 2022, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 54% and our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow was 71% if you exclude the $3.2 billion investment in the acquisition of Navitas Midstream. Total capital expenditures in 2022 were $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion for the acquisition of Navitas and the purchase of the 580 miles of pipelines, $1.4 billion for investment in organic growth capital expenditures and $372 million of sustaining CapEx. As a result of the $200 million of CapEx slipping from 2022 into 2023 and the above additional opportunities in the Permian, we currently expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures to be approximately in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million."
