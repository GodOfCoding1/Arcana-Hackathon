The decrease in revenue is largely attributed to the contribution of the New York State Department of Health Project in the third quarter of 2021 the no comparable project in the reporting quarter, as well as lower univariable systems revenue internationally, which by their nature fluctuate significantly quarter by quarter, or third quarter 2022 revenues does not yet reflect the impact from the phone collaboration, which is expected to be recognized over the term of the agreement, it was the first half of 2023. In the third quarter of 2022, we have to recognize a goodwill impairment charge of $7 million, due to the sharp decrease of options share price over the last month, and a corresponding drop in our company's market capitalization. Thus, our operating expenses for the three months ending September 30 2022, increased notably to $14 million, compared to nearly 6.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, we saw an increase of 29.9% in operating expenses, from 20 point 4 million in the nine months of 2021 to $26.5 million in the comparable period this year, but operating expenses would have been would have decreased more than 4% if the goodwill impairment charge was excluded. Third quarter 2022 r&d expenses were to $2.0 million, compared to $2.4 million in q3 of 2021. r&d expenses in the first nine months of 2022 were $6.6 million down by 18.5% from $8.2 million in the nine months of 2021. Our goals for the longer term include expanding our our services business, as well as collaborations and partnerships with multiple ongoing conversations with potential us accounts and leading organizations in NGS diagnostics and pharma are newly opened with us next generation sequencing services lab here in Rockville, Maryland, is currently processing hundreds of samples for NGS sequencing for the UTI clinical trial, which was lower than anticipated 2022 signing of new contracts and ramp up of revenue on the signed contracts and collaboration agreements. So the sample prep and the Thermo Fisher quants studio five for the PCR, those instruments, both the Kaijin EZ one and the Thermo Fisher Qs five first have to be gone taken through IQ OQ testing by the respective Kaijin and thermo fisher field service engineering representatives that happens during the month of October at both sites, only then can we at OpGen upload the FDA cleared software and basically turn these systems into OpGen qualified systems for the Acuitas AMR gene panel testing, which basically means from contract signature to beginning to recognize revenues, there is a certain time lag to anticipate for the installation, the IQ OQ by external third parties, and then basically ordering shipping kits until the site begin testing but both of them have received consumables."
