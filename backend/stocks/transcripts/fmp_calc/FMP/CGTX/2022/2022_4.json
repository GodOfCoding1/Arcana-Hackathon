Supported by multiple grants totaling approximately $30 million from the National Institute on Aging, our 144 patient Phase 2 SHINE trial for mild to moderate disease has been expanded internationally to Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic where patients are currently being dosed. Our SHIMMER study CT1812, which is also supported by a non-dilutive grant from the NIA for $30 million is enrolling patients with mild to moderate dementia with Lewy bodies in a Phase 2 U.S. based trial. Shifting to the opportunity for CT1812 and ophthalmic indications, dry AMD and geographic atrophy, we presented data in connection with the ARVO conference that supports the proof of concept for geographic atrophy, secondary to dry AMD, somewhat paralleling the challenges to developing treatments for dementia, dry AMD is an area that has frustrated the ophthalmology community for decades with many failed attempts to develop effective treatments. Looking at our opportunity, we have evidence from genome wide study as well as analyses of results from our Alzheimer's studies that demonstrate the treatment with CT1812 may have a beneficial impact on proteins implicated in dry AMD. As we recently announced, we've received FDA clearance to initiate a Phase 2 dry AMD geographic atrophy trial, which we plan to commence this year, the MAGNIFY trial, as we call it, is a randomized placebo controlled Phase 2 trial expected to enroll approximately 240 people who've been diagnosed with dry AMD and measurable geographic atrophy."
