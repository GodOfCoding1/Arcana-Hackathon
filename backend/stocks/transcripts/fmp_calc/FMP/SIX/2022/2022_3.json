    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter was $505 million, a decrease of $133 million or 21%, compared to the third quarter 2021, largely driven by lower attendance offset by higher per capita spending. Despite these inflationary pressures, our first nine months of cash, operating expenses and SG&A decreased by $41 million for 7% versus 2019 due to our aggressive optimization of seasonal labor, based on lower attendance levels, less dollars spent on advertising as well as a leaner corporate overhead structure. I just want to go back to one detail from the very first question where we're looking at cash OpEx in the third quarter, which was down, if math is correct, around $23 million or 10% versus 2019 and that's been a progressively bigger reduction through the course of the year."
