    "content": " My name is  , and I will be your operator for today's call. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Purtell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. In addition, on the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. Investors can find both a detailed discussion of business risks and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the company's annual reports, quarterly reports, and other forms filed or furnished with the SEC. Over the past few months, we have been executing quickly to improve the guest experience focusing on our largest part first and implementing the sixth objective I highlighted on our last earning calls. While it is early, we are very pleased with our progress improving right throughput which has increased our rides per guest per day. In my first 100 days, I was shocked to learn that nearly 30% of the seats on our coasters are empty every time a train leaves the station. To fix this issue, we have implemented single rider lanes on our busiest days allowing guests who are willing to ride solo to move quickly through the line and fill the empty seats. We have moved quickly to update the front gate experience at several of our large parks, including entirely new entrances with a modern aesthetic."
