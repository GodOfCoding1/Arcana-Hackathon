    "content": " I'm proud of our team, which continued delivering awesome results in the first quarter of 2022, including $742 million in Marketplace gross order value or GOV, $131 million in revenues and $21 million in adjusted EBITDA. But as we see trends, and I point back at current quarter, all commentary around the industry, we continue to see a lot of bullishness in the space, fans wanting to get out there, our AOS, as we talked about, higher than historical growth rates as I think demand continues to outpace supply. I think all of these things work together, right, as you look at our investments around brand, product, improved web, improved rewards program, I think the stat I shared earlier is one of all those things working together where we've seen repeat rate in 2 sports categories increased double digits from where they've been historically. And when you look at what we've done in terms of investing across our SkyBox platform, which continues to be the leading ERP with new features, better data, better integrations to allow sellers to grow and run their businesses independently, I think it's no surprise of the investments we've put there on top of, I would say, think about customer service and customer experience, we've certainly invested across that space as well."
