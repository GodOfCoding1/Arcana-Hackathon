    "content": " Second quarter 2022, marketplace GOV increased 18% year-over-year, driven by a 41% increase in marketplace orders, while average order size declined by 16%, yet remained 13% above Q2 2019 levels as average order size returns to a normalized trend line. Your line is open. Your line is open. How should investors think about continued strong demand in this space in the context of your, now increased guidance that still implies sort of year-over-year GOV and revenue declines and understanding all the macro uncertainties and that you are facing pretty difficult comps in the second half. Yeah, I'd say as we've outlined our guidance and updated it in each of the last few quarters I think we've indicated we're trying to strike a balance recognizing that particularly in the first half of the year there was a lot of uncertainty around COVID. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think consistent with what we've said across the board I think one of our main investment areas is going to be in the marketing arena driving I think both awareness and diversification of our channels, such that we can bring I think the message of what is a clearly differentiated and compelling proposition of a product that contains both rewards best customer service in the industry as noted by Newsweek as well as now the ability to play in our daily fantasy offering in Vivid Picks. When you look at the product initiatives, I think as you can see on the surface, we've certainly built I think best-in-class technology now across the web platform across, our seller ecosystem, across our distribution platform by the way which also I think last quarter we announced Capital One. Your line is open. Your line is open."
