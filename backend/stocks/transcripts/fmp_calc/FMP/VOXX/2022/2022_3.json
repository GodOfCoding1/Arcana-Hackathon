    "content": " We see growth and improved profitability going into next fiscal year and beyond, especially with the new OEM award we received this past quarter from Stellantis, which is estimated to be approximately $125 million. Automotive segment sales were up year-over-year by about $100,000, with OEM product sales up $4.4 million and with aftermarket down $4.3 million, primarily due to chip shortages and some delays as we moved from airfreight to boat. Overall, we\u2019re operating a smaller but profitable business, which globally should be $90 million to $100 million in sales. Within the Consumer segment, we had lower sales than last year\u2019s Q3, down $9.3 million. To put this year\u2019s Q3 performance in perspective, the last time we reported higher than $8 million in operating income was fiscal 2015."
