    "content": " And that is because over the past approximately three years, we have been awarded $750 million in new OEM awards, most of which are in front of us over the next five years. Our Automotive segment is poised for a strong growth in the coming years, with approximately $400 million in awards with Stellantis, $200 million with Ford, $60 million awards with Oshkosh Defense, over $30 million in awards with Nissan, $30 million in awards at VSM with heavy-duty truck manufacturers, and over $30 million in awards for accessories, security, and remote starts with multiple manufacturers. As a result of lower sales and gross margins and higher operating expenses, we reported an operating loss of $6.7 million as compared to an operating loss of $400,000 in fiscal 2022 first quarter. For the same periods, interest and bank charges were $730,000 and $528,000 and equity and income of equity investees which relates to our 50% non-controlling ownership interest in ASA Electronics was $1.6 million compared to $2.7 million prior year quarter. In fiscal 2023 first quarter, we recorded an additional accrued interest expense of $1 million related to the interim arbitration award, which is pending the judge's ruling. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 first quarter was a loss of approximately $100,000 as compared to an adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2022 first quarter of $8.2 million. During the 3 months ended May 31, 2022, we accrued an additional charge of approximately $1 million, representing interest due on the awards, which will only be paid if confirmed and not vacated by the U.S. District Court or an appellate court."
