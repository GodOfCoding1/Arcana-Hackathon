    "content": " While OEM grew year-over-year, growth was held in check by the supply chain issues based by our customers, and I estimate we lost between $9 million and $10 million of projected sales, with the biggest shortfall at Stellantis. Aftermarket sales were down $13.6 million with security and satellite radio products accounting for $11.8 million and $1.2 million of decline, respectively, with remain to spread across various categories in some offsets. Onkyo and Pioneer related product sales were up $9.4 million for the comparable third quarter periods, which offset the decline in European premium audio product sales of $9.4 million. Within G&A expenses, which declined by $3.8 million, salary expense declined by $2.4 million, legal and professional fees declined by $700,000 and we incurred approximately $300,000 of restructuring related expenses related to our new OEM Mexico facility. Engineering and tactical sport expenses declined by $2.5 million, with $2.2 million related to headcount reductions in the Biometric segment, which took place in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and lower development expenses and other segments. Additionally, interest in bank charges increased by $700,000, equity and income of equity investee, which is for our 50-50 joint venture with ASA declined by $200,000 and other net improved by $600,000 and this primarily -- and this is primarily related to net foreign exchange currency gains in fiscal 2023 third quarter compared to net foreign currency losses in the comparable period principally due to the dollar strengthening versus the yen."
