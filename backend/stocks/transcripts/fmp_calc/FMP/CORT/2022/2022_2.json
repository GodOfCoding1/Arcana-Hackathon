    "content": " This year, we will see important results from our Phase 2 GRATITUDE trials, an anti-psychotic induced weight gain and our dose ranging study in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. Our trial is evaluating with a relacorilant and treat these patients Cushing's Syndrome by reducing excess cortisol activity and by reversing cortisol induced immune suppression, allow pembrolizumab to achieve its own cancer killing effect. So remind you again, this is a study that he had great interest to us that he has now gotten funded to look at patients pre prostatectomy that obviously that's about as early as you can get that's before diagnosis and even surgery does seem like Enzalutamide actually has real benefit for those patients in the long run. So we think that on the field is very, very interested in what's really kind of a standard double- blind study, we'll see what the results will be, patients ranging from the best places to maybe the point that I'll leave you with is that what was once really sort of tossed off as not really very important is no longer tossed off."
