    "content": " We are conducting an open label Phase 1b trial of relacorilant plus the PD1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, Merck's drug KEYTRUDA, in patients with advanced adrenal cancer whose tumors produce excess cortisol. All right, thank you. I know no one's ever done, sometimes either of these two studies, which is, can you reduce the weight gain caused by antipsychotic medication at all, and insert the news, the early study are people who you can really track to the very beginning when they began their antipsychotic medication, it's within the last six months. Can you actually take away that weight gain, or take a look at the other group of which the numbers in the United States are, are really ample of patients who have taken antipsychotic medication for a long time and have substantial weight gain, but are little, potentially a little less specific to the antipsychotic medication, because they live their life in America and American diet, and so on, and so forth. All right, thank you. But it would be a terrific experiment because one of the things that any clinician will tell you is that patients can have severe Cushing syndrome with moderate levels of cortisol excess and moderate Cushing syndrome with extraordinarily high levels of cortisol excess, it doesn't really match up so well."
