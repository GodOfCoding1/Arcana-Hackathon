    "content": "  For the third quarter of 2022 net revenue decreased 2.6% or $1.8 million to $66.3 million from $68.1 million in the year ago quarter primarily due to softer consumer demand on marketplaces offset by increased net revenue due to our decision to sell off the inventory through reduced pricing, to decrease our inventory levels on hand. Third quarter 2022 net loss includes an impact of operating loss included in the non-cash $9.9 million of impairment of goodwill, again a $5.5 million in net charges from the changes in fair value of warrants and a $12.8 million loss from the derivative related to the offering of common stock, while third quarter of 2021 included $107 million loss from extinguishment of debt, and $8.1 million gain from the change of fair value of warrant and a $1.4  million loss associated with a derivative liability in our term loan at the time."
