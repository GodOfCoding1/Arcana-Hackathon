    "content": " For the fourth quarter of '22, net revenue declined 13.3% and to $54.9 million from $63.3 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to reduced consumer demand, offset by a strategy of liquidating high-cost inventory. The year ago quarter net revenue of $63.3 million was comprised primarily of $31.3 million of our organic business, $27.6 million of net revenue from our acquisitions and $4.4 million of wholesale revenue. Our organic revenue increased by $21 million due to classification of our past acquisition revenue going into organic revenue, our strategy to sell off higher-priced inventory and normalized inventory levels, offset by reduced consumer demand in the period. Looking at our fourth quarter net revenue by phase, the $54.9 million broke down as follows: million, $0.1 million in launch and $13 million in liquidate and inventory normalization. Our working capital improvement was part of our goal to strengthen the balance sheet, driven by moving out our more expensive long inventory and at December 31 inventory landed at $43.3 million, we have made great strides in Q3 and Q4 of improving our inventory composition and reducing our overall inventory as we expect to be completed with this process by mid-Q2 '23. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is beginning to show improvement as we progress towards adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of -- for the first quarter of '23, we expect adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $4.8 million to $5.8 million, anticipating continued impact of inventory liquidation. And the answer to your question relies on really how can we optimize the BPL distribution of the products that go to FDA to reduce the cost of NBA, meaning if you have -- again, we have, I think, at this point, over 19 3PLs, maybe 1 less because we're optimizing all the time."
