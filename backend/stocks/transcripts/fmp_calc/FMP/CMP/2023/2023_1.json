    "content": " Year-over-year, we saw an improvement in select financial measures with consolidated revenue increasing 6% to $352 million, consolidated operating earnings up 37% and consolidated adjusted EBITDA around $62 million, up 6%. Beginning with our salt segment, salt revenue totaled $308 million for the quarter, up 12% year-over-year, driven by 10% higher price and 2% growth in sales volumes. Within our C&I business, volumes declined 2% year over year, driven primarily by the timing of water care sales and slightly weaker consumer deicing demand, while price rose 9% to approximately $190 per ton. Overall, this translated into higher operating earnings and EBITDA for the salt segment with operating earnings rising 20% year over year to $47.1 million and EBITDA rising 10% to $61 million. We made progress on that goal this quarter and continue to see a path towards achieving profitability in the range of $19 to $20 of EBITDA per ton, assuming normalized winter occurs the rest of the second quarter with the second half higher than the first, reflecting the fact that our higher margin per ton C&I business makes up a greater percentage of our revenue in the second half than it does in the first. From a profitability perspective, plant nutrition EBITDA came in at $19.3 million, up 5% year-over-year, despite lower sales volumes and higher product costs on strong pricing, which rose 40% to roughly $924 per ton."
