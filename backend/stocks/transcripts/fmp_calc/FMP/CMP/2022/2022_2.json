    "content": " Despite the revenue increase, our consolidated operating earnings declined to $20 million and adjusted EBITDA declined to $64.8 million or by 42% year-over-year, as upward pressure on distribution and production costs within the Salt segment and higher SOP production costs more than offset favorable plant nutrition pricing. Specifically, we are introducing second half fiscal '22 Salt segment adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $60 million to $75 million, down from our expectation at the time of our February earnings call and second half Plant Nutrition segment adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $25 million to $35 million, roughly in line with our February outlook, reflecting our expectation that the substantially higher-than-expected SOP pricing will be largely offset by lower-than-expected sales and higher-than-expected unit costs due to the lower production levels at our Ogden facility."
