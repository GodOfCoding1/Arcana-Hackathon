    "content": " Consolidated revenue was $331.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, up 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volumes in our North America highway business favorable pricing in our plant nutrition segment and C&I business. Despite the revenue increase, our consolidated operating earnings declined to $20.4 million and adjusted EBITDA declined by $3.6 million to $58.4 million or 6% year-over-year as upward pressure on distribution and product costs within the salt segment in particular, more than offset exceptional plant nutrition price performance and EBITDA growth. Overall, despite higher revenue, salt operating earnings fell 11% year-over-year, while EBITDA fell approximately 10% to $55.6 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting the inflationary effects on distribution costs, not fully captured during the most recent salt bid season and higher product costs."
