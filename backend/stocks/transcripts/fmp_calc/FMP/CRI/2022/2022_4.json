    "content": " Our retail segment was the largest contributor to our sales and profitability last year, our Retail segment achieved a 15% operating margin, driven by better price realization and productivity improvements. Collectively, our international wholesale customers outside of North America contributed over $100 million in sales last year and those sales were margin accretive. We expect that our profitability in the years ahead will be driven by a higher mix of omni-channel sales, a better mix of higher margin stores, and a greater concentration of our wholesale business with fewer, better and growing retailers. Our Carter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand is the best-selling brand online in North America together with our wholesale customers, the online retail sales of our brands last year exceeded $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $119 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 13%, which as I mentioned earlier was comparable to the prior year. So comparing to that relatively strong first quarter last year, We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting first quarter will represent the largest decrease versus 2022 in sales and earnings, with year-over-year performance expected to improve as we move through the subsequent quarters of the year. Your line is now open. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of both. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of both. Your line is now open.
