    "content": " Looking at first quarter financial highlights versus prior year, net sales were up 19% and exceeded $1 billion, a remarkable performance on top of a 47% increase in 2021. We expect the strong performance to continue with growth in the second quarter amplified by sales tied to the theatrical releases of Universal's Jurassic World and Minions, as well as Disney and Pixar's Lightyear. Adjusted operating income was $90 million, up 190% as we scale the business, while adjusted operating income margin increased by 520 basis points to 8.7%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $60 million, or 65%, driven primarily by top line growth. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $322 million, an increase of 4% due to employee-related expenses, as well as higher bad debt expense related to the Russia-Ukraine war, partly offset by incremental optimizing for growth savings. We expect the negative gross margin impact of inflation will be mostly offset by the benefits from pricing, including the incremental 2022 actions, fixed cost scale benefit from top line growth, and anticipated savings from the optimizing for growth program. It's our fastest growing region and really comprehensive growth across all markets, positive POS, a 29% increase in gross billings and it's just a continuation of the great performance we\u2019ve seen in the region over the last couple of years."
