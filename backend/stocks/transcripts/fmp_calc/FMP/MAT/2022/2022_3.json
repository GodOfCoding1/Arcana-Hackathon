Looking at gross billings in the third quarter and constant currency, compared to the prior year, Mattel grew 3%, vehicles, action figures and building sets all grew double digits, while dance was flat, and Infant Toddler & Preschool declined single digits. As we expect higher pressure on gross margin, we're revising guidance for 2022 adjusted EBITDA down slightly to $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, representing growth of 4% to 9% versus 2021. Adjusted operating income was $398 million, declining 1% due primarily to an increase in advertising expense, mostly offset by the increased adjusted gross margin percentage. Adjusted operating income declined by 1% to $398 million, due to higher advertising expense, mostly offset by an increase in adjusted gross margin. Total debt net of the cash balance or net debt declined to $2.225 billion compared to $2.549 billion in the prior year, an improvement of 324 million reflecting our free cash flow generation over the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, slightly below our prior guidance and up from a 2021 base of $1.007 billion, representing growth of 4% to 9%.
