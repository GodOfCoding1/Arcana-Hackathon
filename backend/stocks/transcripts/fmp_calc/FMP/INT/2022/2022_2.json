    "content": " Simply put, we delivered solid results even though our aviation business continues to be significantly impacted by severe market pricing backwardation throughout most of the second quarter given the principally contract-oriented nature of our aviation business. Sustained high fuel prices and increasing volume drove consolidated revenue to a record $17.1 billion in the second quarter, up more than 140% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $76 million, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2021, again, despite the significant negative backwardation related impact to aviation results this past quarter. However, the segment's second quarter gross profit declined to $53 million, which is down 40% year-over-year, driven principally by the impact of severe market pricing backwardation and to a lesser extent, the exit from Afghanistan last year. As we look ahead to the seasonally strong third quarter and with the backwardation issue generally behind us, we expect aviation gross profit to rebound significantly with results expected to be up year-over-year despite the discontinuation of the Afghanistan business last year. That's up 5% sequentially, principally driven by higher operating expenses associated with increased business activity during the second quarter. Our interest expense was $25.9 million in the second quarter, significantly higher than recent run rates, principally related to rapidly rising interest rates as well as increased borrowings under our credit facility and increased activity under our trade finance facility, both associated with growing volumes and high fuel prices throughout the quarter. Despite a 14% sequential increase in average fuel prices and higher volumes during the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $43 million."
