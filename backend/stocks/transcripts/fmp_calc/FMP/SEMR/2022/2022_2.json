    "content": " Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, expected growth, adoption and demand for our products and features, expected investments acquisitions and their anticipated benefits, industry and market trends, our competitive position, our market strategies, market opportunities, our guidance for the third quarter of 2022 and the full year 2022, and our ability to successfully relocate employees outside Russia, including executing our relocation plans on the timeline we expect and at the anticipated cost, can be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek or will. Your line is open. Your line is open. I would say it's more of an anecdote that you can use to make judgment about the overall market environment, but in terms of numbers it doesn't really impact us just because Kompyte was so much smaller than the whole scale of Semrush and kind potential cross sell opportunity. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
