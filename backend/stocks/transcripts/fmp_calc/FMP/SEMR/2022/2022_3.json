    "content": " Forward-looking statements include statements concerning our expected future business, and financial performance, and financial condition, expected growth, adoption and demand for new and existing products and features, industry and market trends, our competitive position, our market strategies, market opportunities, our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the full-year 2022, and our ability to successfully relocate employees outside Russia, including executing our relocation plans on the timeline we expect, and at the anticipated cost. Despite a more uncertain demand environment, we experienced solid growth with revenue of $65.8 million, up 34% year-over-year, and up 5% from the previous quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses, including exit costs were $55.8 million in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year and up 6% for the previous quarter with the majority of growth coming from investment in sales and marketing. Strong revenue growth and higher cost margins were more than offset by higher expenses and contributed to a non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of $12,000 a year ago, and non-GAAP net loss of $6.1 million in the second quarter. Otherwise, , which may be contrary to this, when we look at blended rates, we have our 10k per year customers growing 12% quarter-over-quarter by number of ways, or more than -- I think it's more than 70% year-over-year, so, a substantial growth in higher priced account."
