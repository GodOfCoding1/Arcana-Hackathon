    "content": " Looking at the full year 2022, revenue increased to a record $598 million, up 10.6%, a pace well above the industry's growth. We delivered net revenue of $146.5 million, an increase of 10.2% over the same period last year and $2 million above the high end of our guidance range despite reducing marketing spend by 41% year-over-year. Despite softer industry-wide traffic, our stores that were opened for the full 12 months in 2022 generated approximately $2.1 million in revenue on average with 4-wall margins in line with our historical target of 35%. Since reducing marketing spend to low double digits, we've seen our customer acquisition costs come down approximately 36% for the second half of 2022 compared to the second half of 2021, driving increased leverage. This better-than-expected finish to the year brought 2022 revenue to $598.1 million, representing growth of 10.6% versus full year 2021 in a year marked by macroeconomic challenges that pressured industry demand. From a customer perspective, we finished 2022 with 2.28 million active customers, an increase of 3.6% year-over-year and grew average revenue per customer from $246 to $263, representing an increase of 6.9% year-over-year. In Q4, we saw e-commerce down 1.6% in 2022 versus Q4 2021, which coincides with a 41% drop in marketing spend from $29.6 million to $17.6 million and from 22.3% of revenue to 12% of revenue in the quarter. This compares to Q4 2021 adjusted SG&A of $89.4 million or 67.3% of revenue, a drop of 11.7 points year-over-year. For the full year, on an adjusted basis, SG&A came in at $348.5 million or 58.3% as a percentage of net revenue versus 58.4% in 2021. Therefore, we're planning for a range of scenarios for the full year 2023, we're guiding to the following: revenue growth of approximately 8% to 10%, representing a revenue range of $645 million to $660 million, adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 7.9%, which equates to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $51.5 million at the midpoint of our top line guidance range. For 2023, we expect marketing spend to be in the low 'teens as a percent of revenue, which compares to approximately 20% in the first quarter last year and 17% for the first half of 2022. We noted that we saw north of 80% year-over-year growth in our contacts business and are really excited by the trends and the feedback that we're seeing there; both in converting existing Warby Parker customers who were contacts to enable them to buy those contacts from us and also in attracting new customers to Warby, where their first purchase is contacts. So if we were to double click into that 10.6% revenue growth, we have a business split that's approximately, at this point; 2/3 retail, 1/3 e-commerce, with our retail channel; up 25%, growing in line with store growth, while e-com revenue was down 6%, really in many ways, driven by the fact that over the course of the full year, we've dropped marketing spend by 15% in the most recent quarter by 40% year-over-year."
