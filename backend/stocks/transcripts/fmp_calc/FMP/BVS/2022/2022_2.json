    "content": " Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations of management and involve inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated, including the risks and uncertainties described in the company's filings with the SEC, including Item 1A Risk Factors of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. A few of our successes to date include closing the financing and acquisition of CartiHeal, completing the integration of Bioness and materially progressing on the integration of Misonix and positioning ourselves to achieve double-digit organic growth for the year by leveraging our technology-leading medical devices, our significant commercial organization and improving market access with expanded reimbursement and preferred coverage agreements across our verticals. Moving to our results, revenue increased 28% during the second quarter to $140 million, including organic growth of 8%, which positions us well to achieve double-digit growth for the year. Across pain treatments, we saw double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued market share gains by our single-injection Durolane HA therapy and our three injection Gelsyn HA therapy as we highlighted on previous earnings calls reimbursement for HA shifted from wholesale acquisition cost to average selling price at the end of June. And then with the MDR certification process in Europe, which we expect to get cleared up in the late third quarter and begin shipping those units in the fourth quarter, when we add that into the mix with our continued growth across our business, pain treatments and surgical solutions as well, the double-digit growth there."
