    "content": " Our revenue shortfall in the quarter can primarily be attributed to transitory headwinds related to Gelsyn, our three-injection HA therapy, as well as changes in customer buying patterns near the end of the quarter due to reimbursement changes announced by Medicare that resulted in greater-than-expected volatility across our entire HA portfolio. Organic growth of 8 percentage points was enhanced from the recovery in our advanced rehabilitation portfolio from supply chain challenges, seen in prior quarter and offset by slower-than-expected recovery in Exogen. In terms of all the tailwinds we see in 2023 and we obviously build this business over the past 20 months with a long-term view of driving growth and when we look at it, obviously, we're a one-year post integration of Misonix and we see a significant growth and opportunity in surgical solutions that includes the bone scalpel as well as the bone graft substitutes."
