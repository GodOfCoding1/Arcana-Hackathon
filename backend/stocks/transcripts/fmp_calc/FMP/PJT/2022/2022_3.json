    "content": " Beginning with revenues, total revenues for the third quarter were $266 million, up 15% year-over-year, driven by meaningful growth in both Strategic Advisory and restructuring revenues and a slight increase in PJT Park Hill revenues. For the 9 months ended September 30, total revenues were $746 million, up 10% year-over-year, with significant revenue increases in Restructuring in PJT Park Hill and a modest increase in Strategic Advisory revenues compared to the prior year. Although we delivered record Strategic Advisory revenues for the 9-month period, given deals pushed out and deals withdrawn, we no longer expect our full year Strategic Advisory revenues to exceed last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record levels."
