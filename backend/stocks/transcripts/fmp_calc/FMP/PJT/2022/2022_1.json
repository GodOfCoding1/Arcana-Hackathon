    "content": " Our PJT Park Hill and restructuring businesses delivered significant year-over-year growth in revenues, with strategic advisory revenues down just slightly compared to strong year ago levels. And I think it's important to just look at the sheer volume of activity last year and the fact that we're -- with all of this volatility and with all this uncertainty and with this move in rates, the way we look at it, the M&A global market volumes are down about 15% year-to-date. And if you look at this down 15% in activity levels globally, year-to-date, the way we measure it, and we look at it , because I've always questioned whether  transactions are really another form of IPO, whether they're really true M&A business. And as we no longer have that headwind, I think the strength of our other businesses which was really the case in 2021, but it was obscured by the pullback in restructuring that that's increasingly shining through, and you're now being able to see, because you no longer have the restructuring headwinds, you're seeing the core underlying strength in our Park Hill business, our Camberview business, our strategic advisory business."
