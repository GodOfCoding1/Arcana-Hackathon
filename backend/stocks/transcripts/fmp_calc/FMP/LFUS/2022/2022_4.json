    "content": " 2022 was truly an exceptional year for Littelfuse, as we continue to expand our leadership in high-growth end markets with significant new business wins and strategic acquisitions. Margins finished at nearly 29% for the year and adjusted EBITDA margins at 33.5%, both expanding 500 basis points versus last year and well above our segment target range. Within Commercial Vehicles, sales for the quarter were up 7% organically and up 9% for the year as we delivered on content growth while leveraging strong end markets. We're seeing a broad range of signals across our end markets, ranging from continued growth across key mobility themes, Industrial and Commercial Vehicle markets, offset by weakness across many of our Electronics end markets. Sequentially, we expect first quarter adjusted earnings to decline 15%, reflecting the segment mix of electronics sales declining sequentially, partially offset by sales growth across the Industrial and Transportation. By segment, we're projecting Electronics operating margins to average over 20%, Industrial in the upper teens and Transportation improving through the year with double-digit operating margins in the back half of the year."
