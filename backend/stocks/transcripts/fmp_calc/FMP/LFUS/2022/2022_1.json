We'll take our next caller, please. We'll take our next caller, please. We'll take our next caller, please. We'll take our next caller, please. We've been talking, Matt, really about what we're doing around the different levers that we've not gone into detail quantification, but what I would say is we've done a lot of work in the past few quarters really around catch-up, ride-out round, really making sure that the value we're bringing to our customers is recognized, given the fact that our costs have gone up due to a lot of market factors. We'll take our next caller, please. So that's been some of the waves that we've seen on our OpEx spend frankly, and that's also been -- right now I'd say in the current market dynamics, that's been one of the unique drivers that we're just not spending at the level we would in some areas on OpEx.
