    "content": " One was the fact that we had an additional COVID shutdown, in July, we were able to continue partial operations operate in a bubble, et cetera, that is hampering a little bit of our third quarter as well as the fact that with the shutdowns in the second quarter, we were able to sell for -- related to COVID, we were able to sell inventory, but we've got inventory in production that we've got to build back up, and that's also hampering sales in the third quarter. And then I'd say, lastly, we also talked about a little bit of softness that we're seeing in a couple of our end markets, small portion, but what I call the consumer-oriented appliances and personal electronics, that's also hampering organic a little bit. So again, I talked about the fact that in general, right, price cost has been very strong around that, just the fact that our teams have done really a tremendous job where we have seen those inflationary costs pick up, we have gone back to our customers really rearticulating the value that we're providing and really making sure that, that value stands out, and that's where really our pricing actions have come from. We will take our next caller, please. And Matt, on the Electronics side, other than those small pockets we talked about that Meenal mentioned or we mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the kind of personal electronics space, small appliances, that kind of thing, which particularly in Asia, where a lot of that demand from our customer base is, has softened a little bit, but the broader electronics market continues to be still a really strong POS that we see. We will take our next caller, please. We will take our next caller, please."
