    "content": " We will begin today's call with Tom providing a summary update on the current business environment and update on our capacity expansion in technologies, following which, Dave will provide details on our end markets and second quarter results and also provide third quarter guidance. Average selling price, ASP, per wafer increased approximately 16% year-over-year, driven by ramping long term customer agreements with better pricing, a constructive transactional pricing environment, as well as continued improvement in product mix. Revenue in this market was approximately 4% of our total second quarter revenue and grew approximately 34% year-over-year, driven by the ramp of new products in ADAS, safety and infotainment. Next, our communications, infrastructure and data center end market comprised approximately 17% of second quarter revenue and grew approximately 50% year-over-year. Next, and as expected, our compute end market declined year-over-year and comprised approximately 5% of total second quarter revenue. GF delivered operating profit of approximately $350 million for the quarter, which translates into an approximately 18% adjusted operating margin, roughly 15 percentage points better than the year ago period and $45 million higher than the high end of our guidance range."
