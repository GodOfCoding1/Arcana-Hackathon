    "content": " Today, I'd like to briefly cover three areas: first, our performance scorecard; second, the current environment, and how our major asset classes are performing; last, some of the high level takeaways from our recent white paper, which we view as the beginning of a very important education process entitled private and listed infrastructure the case for a complete portfolio. Typically as listed infrastructure companies sell assets to these private funds, these transactions are coming at significant premiums compared to where the listed companies are trading, supporting our view that the public infrastructure markets are attractively priced relative to private market valuations, creating a tactical opportunity within what we think is a strategic allocation. Before new accounts were in global listed infrastructure from an African sovereign wealth plan, in U.S. REITs for our corporate pension and multi-strategy real assets for a corporate pension and a global listed -- global real estate, which was a takeaway from an underperforming peer manager for a state pension fund. I mentioned that we've had a couple of clients trim their portfolios to fund private commitments that actually feels a little bit opposite of what as Jon laid out, what we would recommend investors to do at this point because the cycle -- our history has played out the same many, many times and that's listed goes down first, then the private market corrects, but then listed recovers first."
