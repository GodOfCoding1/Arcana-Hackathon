    "content": " And closed-end funds recorded $554 million of inflows, primarily due to the IPO of Cohen & Steers\u2019s Real-Estate opportunities and income fund. Inflation catalyzed continued flows into U.S. real estate, global real estate, listed infrastructure and multi strategy real asset portfolios, while the shift in fed policy prompted some investors to sell preferreds with our core and low duration strategies. Bright spots in our open-end fund activity are connected to the inflation theme, including U.S. and global real estate strategies, listed infrastructure and our real assets, multi strategy portfolios, which include resource equities and commodities, some of the best performing markets in the first quarter. In terms of business strategy, we are actively focused on a number of fronts, including continued organic growth, innovating and broadening our investment capabilities, developing inflation solutions, capitalizing on the closed end fund 2.0 market, launching our private listed real estate strategies, and importantly, adding to and developing our talent."
