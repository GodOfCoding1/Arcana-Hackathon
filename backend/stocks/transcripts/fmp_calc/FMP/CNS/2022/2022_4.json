    "content": " As mentioned on previous calls, our business has become more capital intensive, potential uses of capital range from funding the upfront costs associated with closed-end fund launches and rights offerings, seeding new strategies and vehicles, co-investing in private real estate vehicles and making various one-time investments to grow our firm infrastructure as our business scales. In terms of how we see our biggest asset class real estate, in 2022, U.S. REITs were down roughly 25% as the listed asset class re-priced quickly to the chain macro environment. Notably, our market share, as measured by active open-end funds continues to expand in U.S. real estate, global real estate and global listed infrastructure, with U.S. real estate most notable at 37%. 72% of our pipeline AUM is in global real estate strategies, led by a recently won completion portfolio, which is a customized strategy designed to complement existing private holdings by expressing allocations in the listed market that are cheaper or cannot be expressed in the private market. Just sticking with the U.S., there are -- when you look at our shadow pipeline, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some very large pension plans that are conducting searches for strategies like U.S. real estate, global infrastructure and our multi-strategy real assets portfolio, which is consistent with the comments around investors."
