    "content": " Excluding accounting related adjustments, the provision would've been $6 million in the fourth quarter, with the increase largely due to the impairment of the relationship that Dennis discussed earlier. You know what I'm saying, excluding mortgage should -- I mean, the expense with mortgage will go up through the year and probably come back down to the fourth quarter as production decline. We have -- the slide he's referring to builds up pretax, pre-provision, starting with our run rate in the fourth quarter shows the impact of mortgage improvement that we just talked about, the improvement in Panacea and Life Premium Finance and builds us up to a higher run rate or a higher full year pretax, pre-provision for 2023. I haven't been trying to think about the ROA on a quarterly basis when we put that together, because that includes mortgage contribution, which is only going to be breakeven in the first quarter, but more meaningful contribution in second and third quarter and then you get the ramp for Panacea and Life Premium Finance over time. I'd say the first half probably is closer to 90, and the second half is probably closer to 110, even with mortgage dipping a little in the fourth quarter, I still think second half of the year -- probably 110 and maybe the fourth quarter like a 105, probably what I had to guess."
