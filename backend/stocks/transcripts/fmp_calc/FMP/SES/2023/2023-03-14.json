    "content": " And the fact that we've built three A-sample lines, and then we delivered total -- well, we both tested and delivered total -- about a thousand of these large lithium-metal cells just last year, and then also improved the performance of these cells quite a lot. So, the automotive industry already has a lot of data and then a lot of experience with lithium-ion now because lithium-metal is totally new and also we improve the quality and manufacturing feasibility to a level so that we were ready to take this to a new level so that we can actually manufacture more cells and then collect more data. Yes, so back in 2021, we were the first to enter automotive A-sample and then last year '22, that's when we really started manufacturing lithium-metal cells in pilot scale."
