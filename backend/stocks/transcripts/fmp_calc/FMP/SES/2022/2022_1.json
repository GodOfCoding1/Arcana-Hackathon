    "content": " In addition to the supply chain strategy as previously mentioned, we also started developing recycling capability for mossy lithium and exploring new business models such as battery-as-a-service, which will leverage the data analytics capabilities of our Avatar AI software. CapEx in the first quarter was $2.5 million in line with our expectations entering the quarter, approximately 90% of our Q1 CapEx went toward completing phase one of our Shanghai Giga pilot facility which was ready to use at the end of March. And then when we first started building these large 50 amp powers and 100 amp power cells earlier this year, we expected the performance to be much worse than the smaller cells just because it's a new cell format, it\u2019s a new line and we started to optimize things, but basically, we have lots of small challenges to get the performance of the large cells to match the performance of the smaller cells."
