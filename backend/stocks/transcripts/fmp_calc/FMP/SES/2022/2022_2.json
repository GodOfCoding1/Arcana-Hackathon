    "content": " Our R&D expenses were $7.2 million for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $3.7 million from the same period last year. Our G&A expenses were $11.9 million for the second quarter 2022, an increase of $8.8 million from the same period last year. For full year 2022, we continue to expect cash investment in operations to be in the range of $70 million and $80 million, unchanged from our guidance last quarter. For full year 2022, we continue to expect our total use of cash to be between $95 million and $115 million which should leave us with well over $300 million of liquidity entering 2023. So this definitely further supports our goal to not just develop lithium a battery but beyond within Avatar build this entire ecosystem and also sort of copy and paste the mature and highly efficient supply chain that currently exists in China and Korea in North America because at the end of the day, our lithium metal battery will be built using lithium-ion process, so we can actually leverage a lot of the very mature process. So while we start to make more sales out of our Shanghai and Korea facility, we will be spending more money on the material cost to make the cells and we are making a few hundred a month but that number will grow over the course of this year and also next year once the Phase II of Shanghai is up and running and Korea is expanded."
