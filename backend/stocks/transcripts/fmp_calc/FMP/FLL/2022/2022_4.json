We thought we were going to owe now, meaning next week it's owed one month, after you open about $38 million in gaming taxes and that we would owe another $12 million when we opened the permanent casino in three years, because permanent has more gaming capacity. I mean, I don't think it's going to be $200 million, maybe not even $150 million, but $120 million, $130 million, $140 million, somewhere in there and pretty high margins, because it's almost all slot machines. I mean, look, if you run a 40% margin on Dan's run rate number there, you're looking at $40 million of -- roughly $40 million of EBITDA, assuming everything else is breakeven from the restaurant side. I mean, if you -- eventually you will get monthly numbers from the Illinois Gaming Board and if there's one month that's a little below an $8 million per month run rate, I wouldn't worry about it, because it's -- but the trend will gradually be up. I don't think we're going to pay it all back yet in large part just to hold onto some extra liquidity as we kind of weigh through the opening weeks, but not expecting to need it for what it's worth. Chamonix is -- well, it's -- we're spending roughly 10 million bucks a month these days, and we've got $110 million left to spend. So if you're going to include the 7 million already spent plus another couple million, let's say for the first quarter, 10 million of trailing of remainder CapEx at the Temporary plus the gaming license fee."
