    "content": " Yesterday, we reported full year pro forma 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $822.2 million, which was within our revised guidance range provided in August and notably above our initial guidance from last February. As discussed earlier by Matt, high gas transportation capacity utilization rates and continued Permian gas supply growth likely translates to a turbulent year for natural gas pricing at Waha until the new pipeline projects are placed in service later this year and in 2024. And I think with the contracts that were announced in the middle of last year and the new project that was announced this morning or last night, extending into New Mexico, I think should be pretty representative of sort of the market share gains that we are achieving and expect to achieve not just in 2023 but as the New Mexico gathering expansion is completed and move forward into 2024. But as far as -- so it is a portion of obviously the overall capital that we've got $115 million, I think it is, which is allocated this year in gross on the pipeline side."
