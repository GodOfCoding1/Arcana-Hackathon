    "content": " Following our robust second quarter results and updated business outlook, we have revised our 2022 guidance higher for both EBITDA and capital expenditures to reflect additional producer development, new commercial agreements and new capital projects, such as the PHP expansion. During the second quarter, Gulf Coast Express pipeline announced an open season to solicit commitments for an expansion project that would increase GCX's transportation capacity by nearly 570 million cubic feet per day. The revision reflects the incremental $25 million required to construct the infrastructure supporting our new long term gas gathering and processing agreements; approximately $8 million for the 120 million cubic feet per day Diamond Cryo processing expansion, which is expected to be in service first quarter of next year; early capital spend associated with Delaware Link; and some pull forward of Alpine High GMP equipment surplus relocation projects. We're also, I think, spending a whole lot more time on really thinking about our front end aiming treating, what we can do as far as H2S and CO2, the percentage we can take, the gas quality spec range that, that then opens up, because we do see, obviously, a fair amount of variance, particularly as we move up in the basin, up north, sort of Loving County north to the state line and obviously even as you go into New Mexico. I'd say the $25 million of commodity price outperformance that you see on Page 8, when you take just the full year strip -- or actuals today and full year strip on the commodity prices and what we had laid out back in February, I think you'd calibrate around to somewhere close between $35 million and $40 million increase versus our prior 2022 guide."
