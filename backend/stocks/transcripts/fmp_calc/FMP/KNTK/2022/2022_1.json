    "content": " Expected volumes from the new agreements, represent 45% of our $800 million cubic feet a day of latent processing capacity that we had highlighted, and clearly demonstrates the intrinsic and extrinsic value of available processing capacity in today's environment. Having sold out 45% of our latent capacity in two months, which surprised even us, it is meant that we have now accelerated plans to expand our Diamond Cryo's processing capacity by 120 million cubic feet a day by adding additional revenue compression. Turning to our pipeline transportation segment, we announced along with Kinder, the binding Open Season for the Permian Highway pipeline expansion, providing nearly 650 million cubic feet a day of incremental capacity. The long lead times, we think that continued supply chain disruptions makes -- extenuate the timeframes already we know that the long lead items have gone from about 26 weeks to 40 weeks today, that increases you're looking at a year just to get on incremental revenue, --sales compression."
