    "content": " Mark will discuss our guidance in detail later on the call, but these factors include the successful completion of large programs, insufficient new business wins in the second half of 2022 to drive revenues in 2023 and significant revenue reductions on some ongoing programs. We previewed some of these themes on the third quarter earnings call in the context of our preliminary 2023 revenue outlook, namely 6 of the largest programs across the portfolio which combined generated nearly $115 million of revenue in 2022 will face significant revenue headwinds in 2023. Revenues for our security solutions business declined 11% to $30.3 million, primarily due to the final ramp down of the U.S. census program in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a more than 50% reduction in revenues on the second largest program in security solutions due to a lower volume of customer activity on that program partially offset by higher revenues and information assurance. In total, the three largest programs in security solutions generated approximately $70 million in revenues in each of 2021 and 2022, and each of them will experience revenue declines of approximately 50% to 100% in 2023. We expect approximately a $45 million headwind, primarily from the 3 large programs and secure networks that are coming to successful completion. Cash below-the-line expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring costs and D&A are forecasted to be approximately $4.5 million lower primarily due to $6.5 million of lower labor costs, partially offset by $2 million of higher miscellaneous other costs. Gross margin is expected to contract by approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points, primarily due to revenue pressure on high-margin programs partially offset by a more favorable revenue mix between security solutions and secure networks."
