    "content": " The Biden Administration has now submitted its proposed FY 2023 budget to Congress, which calls for a nearly 11% increase in non-defense cybersecurity funding next year, much of this is to help agencies meet the priorities outlined in last year's cyber security executive order. The 54% contribution from security solutions compares favorably to the 41% contribution for the comparable quarter last year, when a large order from a secure networks customer pulled forward from the second quarter to the first quarter of 2021. Gross margins expanded 530 basis points between the trailing 12-month period ending March 31, 2021 and the equivalent period ending March 31, 2022 due to gross margin expansion within both security solutions, as well as secured networks. We expect secured networks revenues to be up mid single digits to mid-teens primarily due to lower revenues in the comparable period last year, as a result of the previously mentioned pull forward of a large order into the first quarter from the second quarter of 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
