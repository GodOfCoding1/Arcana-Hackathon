    "content": " When adjusted for the incentive fee accrual related to net unrealized capital gains in the second incentive fee calculation, adjusted NII of $6.3 million was up 8% from $5.8 million last quarter and as compared to the same amount for last year's Q1. Subsequent to quarter end, we have executed approximately $85 million of new originations in three new portfolio companies, and three follow-ons, with repayments of approximately $106 million in four exits and realizations for a net reduction in investments of $21 million. So that's a good question, especially noting that some of the portfolio companies that have performed particularly well, and you see that evidenced in the valuations this past quarter, were ones where we have meaningful equity investments. But I wouldn't look at our business strategy and think that you're suddenly going to see lots of that that's directionally what we're intending to do is what we've done historically, which is co invest in equity alongside debt investments that we make. But I think it's also, again, important to realize that, you look at the growth in our assets under management has been very rapid, in the last two quarters, I think in our subsequent quarter end I think you'll see that there was significant repayments, the current kind of right after quarter end, but then we've also had significant reinvestment."
