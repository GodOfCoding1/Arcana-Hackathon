    "content": " First, we continued to strengthen our financial foundation in Q2 by maintaining a high level of investment credit quality with 96% of our loan investments retaining our highest credit rating at quarter end, generating a return on equity of 4.8% on a trailing 12-month basis despite recognizing first $5.3 million of net unrealized depreciation, primarily reflecting widening market spreads and broadly syndicated loan market volatility in the CLO and JV and second, $1.2 million in realized loss on extinguishment of our SAK baby bond and SBA debentures and registering a gross unlevered IRR of 10.6% on our total unrealized portfolio and a gross unlevered IRR and of 6.4% on total realizations of $836 million. The $7.9 million net realized gain on investments represent the realization of the equity of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PDDS investment and the $13.3 million net unrealized depreciation primarily reflects: one, $8.0 million reversal of previously recognized depreciation on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PDDS investment; two, $1.2 million unrealized depreciation on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CLO and JV equity investments, reflecting the volatility in the broadly syndicated loan market as of quarter end; three, $1.9 million unrealized depreciation on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pepper Palace investments due to company performance; four, $1.2 million unrealized depreciation on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Zollege investments due to company performance; and five, approximately $3.6 million net unrealized depreciation across the portfolio, reflecting the impact of changing market spreads."
