    "content": " We remain comfortable in our guidance for 2022, including achieving $30 million in top-line revenue, and given our improved margins and operating expenses, we still expect to cross the breakeven mark for positive adjusted EBITDA before the end of the year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing U.S. companies leverage recruiters in Latin America or foreign companies looking for talent in the U.S., and U.S. companies looking for talent outside the U.S. We reported in this call about 10% of our pipeline being outside of the U.S., and I would think that, that would increase in 2023 as global talent becomes more of a norm. Thank you very much. And what our next step is, as I probably \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I mentioned earlier, the first question, is really turning these more self-service throughout the rest of the year into 2023 and really start to capitalize on the white space that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available at the customers that are simply using us for our career communities and really being able to evolve them the way we evolved our larger enterprises and our enterprise clients into significantly spending more with us. So clearly, the biggest shift you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really seeing is really, I would say tech talent and then some financial services we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing also being shifted outside the U.S. Now a lot of this is really related to just the expense side of the talent. Thank you very much."
