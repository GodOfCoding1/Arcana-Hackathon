    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 totaled $6.97 million, an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2021. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $7.6 million, a 14% decrease compared to the operating expenses of $8.9 million in the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to the ongoing efficiencies gained from the integration of staff and assets from our 2021 acquisitions. We're focusing the business on our on-demand revenue and knowing what that revenue looks like given our insight into our customers and the healthy pipeline that we have, we're really building a business around a much, much lower operating expense profile."
