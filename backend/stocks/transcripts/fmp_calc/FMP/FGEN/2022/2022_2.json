    "content": " It is very exciting to be expecting data readouts from four pivotal Phase 3 trials in 2023, the Zephyrus-1 Phase 3 trial in IPF, mid 2023; the LELANTOS-1 and LELANTOS -2 Phase 3 trials in DMD, in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023 respectively; and the Matterhorn Phase 3 trial of roxadustat in MDS in the first half of 2023. Diving deeper into the operational results of our roxadustat business in China, total roxadustat net sales from the joint distribution entity jointly owned by AstraZeneca and FibroGen or JDE was $53.1 million this quarter compared to $52.8 million in the second quarter of 2021. Moving from total roxadustat net sales in China, FibroGen's net transfer price from sales to the JDE was $18.2 million for the second quarter, consistent with the 30% to 45% range of the JDE's roxadustat net sales, which we have continuously guided. Notably, we expect topline data in 2023 from Pamrevlumab, Zephyrus-1 Phase 3 trial in IPF, and the LELANTOS-1 and LELANTOS-1 Phase 3 trials in non-ambulatory and ambulatory DMD respectively, as well as roxadustat, MATTERHORN Phase 3 trial in MDS.
