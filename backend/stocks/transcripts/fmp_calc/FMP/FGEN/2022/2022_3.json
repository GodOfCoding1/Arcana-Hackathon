    "content": " We will use additional proceeds to continue to support our strategic priorities, advancing our late-stage development programs, where we anticipate top line data from 7 pivotal Phase III studies beginning in the first half of 2023 through mid-2024, 5 from pamrevlumab and 2 from roxadustat, as well as progressing our early-stage pipeline. It is important to note the main drivers of change versus the third quarter of 2021, which are: one, a $120 million milestone payment in the last year period from our partner, Astellas, related to the European Commission approval of EVRENZO for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with CKD, and two, a decrease of $24.1 million in co-development revenue from our partners due to substantial completion of the roxadustat development. Moving from roxadustat net sales in China, FibroGen's net transfer price from sales to the JDE was $19.5 million for the third quarter, consistent with the 30% to 45% range of the JDE's roxadustat net sales which we have continuously guided. Considering today's announcement on the royalty monetization transaction with NovaQuest Capital Management, we estimate our 2022 ending cash balance of cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable to be in the range of $380 million to $410 million. And it's pretty interesting because I think what we're learning from other studies in the placebo group, in particular, is that patients who are treatment experienced to go into trials continue to progress over the next year, much more than you would anticipate based on the labels for Esbriet or Ofev."
