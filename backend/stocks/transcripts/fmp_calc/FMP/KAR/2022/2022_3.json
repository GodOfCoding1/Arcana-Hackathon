    "content": " I'd like now to look towards the future and provide some details around the industry outlook, the macro environment, particularly in the areas of new vehicle production, used vehicle pricing, wholesale use vehicle supply, as well as the outlook for commercial volumes. And then just a follow-up on your comment on pricing, with the backdrop of those kinds of constraints on wholesale volumes and the automakers clearly not being able to ramp up production even as much we might have thought a couple months ago, supply will remain constrained on the new vehicle side and we'll see the one to six year old car fleet shrink probably for the next three or four years. I guess what I would say is the strong GPU performance in Q3 gives me confidence that the numbers we put in place in our Analyst Day are very, very achievable and sustainable overtime, although, I don't necessarily expect that they would stay at the sort of $320 per unit level that we saw in the third quarter. I'd say given the changing macro environment, I'd say specifically higher interest rates and also declining used vehicle values, I think it's prudent to expect some increase in the risk environment there."
