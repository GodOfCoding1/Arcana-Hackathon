    "content": " That said we're pleased with our performance, with the performance of our dealer-to-dealer business in the quarter, for an addition to growing our volume by 28%, we increased our revenue per vehicles sold by over 25% versus the same quarter last year. KAR RemainCo's marketplace businesses, OPENLANE, BacklotCars, CARWAVE, ADESA Canada, TradeRev, and ADESA Europe all experienced low supply of wholesale vehicles, especially in January and February. Your line is now open. I think your last comment headwinds the sale of the ADESA physical auctions was announced that the transaction was going to reduce 2022 adjusted EBITDA by $100 million, which I'm assuming is equal outside of any changes in the market or the business more broadly. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
