    "content": " This was demonstrated at last week's Advanced Technologies and Treatment for Diabetes Conference in Barcelona, Spain where data was presented from our Control-IQ observational study, also referred to as the CLIO study, where users reported improved quality of life, reduced diabetes burden and higher satisfaction with diabetes therapy, irrespective of age, baseline hemoglobin A1c and the previous method of insulin delivery. 11:56 Beginning with our results in the US, our first quarter sales grew 27% to $131 million, we shipped nearly 19,000 pumps in the quarter, bringing us to an installed base of more than 250,000 customers. I think what we were seeing in the quarter as much of what you've heard from other companies as well as is, the beginning of it was more pressured as there were more absences due to illnesses as the Omicron wave was kind of running out at that point, but it\u2019s also typical for us to have an uptick across the quarter, particularly in the first quarter with it being the lowest seasonal quarter of the year. 22:35 And in United States there has been -- there has been a new product that has come to market, but I would say, even with that the competitive environment remains largely unchanged, it's been on the market now for a few months, but we have heard conversations about it, but there so few systems that are out there that is really very difficult for us to get a sense for how it's actually performing  keep monitoring and see how that goes in time. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
