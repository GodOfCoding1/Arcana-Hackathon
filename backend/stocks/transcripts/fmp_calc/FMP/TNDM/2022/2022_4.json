    "content": " We demonstrated progress across each of these target populations, which is reflected in the fact that in each quarter throughout 2022, approximately half of our new customers in the U.S. reported that they were adopting pump therapy for the first time and the other half converted from using a different manufacturer's pump. Looking to the year ahead, we are providing 2023 worldwide sales guidance of $885 million to $900 million on a non-GAAP basis, slightly widening the range from our initial 2023 indication to a growth rate of 10% to 12%. And so I think as we said in the prepared remarks, our intent really is to increase the awareness and benefits of Control-IQ and really focus on execution of these new product activities that we've got planned for the year because they are really going to drive the change in the growth curve of the company and get us back to a growth rate that we're used to in the past. And then when you think about the OUS dynamics with that headwind that we're expecting to see in the first half and really most heavily loaded into the first quarter, it makes for a challenging sales number, which really puts pressure on that adjusted EBITDA at the beginning of the year. It did have the most pressure of the year in terms of new pumpers when you're looking year-over-year, I would like to highlight, though, Joanne, that going from Q3 to Q4, we did see a modest increase in new pumpers as well as renewal customers."
