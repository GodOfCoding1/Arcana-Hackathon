And that's really why we've basically recalibrated guidance for the fourth quarter and for next year, really intended to properly align our near-term expectations and really doesn't change our commitment to expansion of the insulin pump market or competitive gains. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But I will point out that we do still expect growth in the fourth quarter and even a step-up in pump shipments from the third quarter in the U.S. and keeping in mind that the renewals continue to have an increased number of opportunities, which will be a great brand spot for us in the fourth quarter, even looking into next year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. If we think new pump sales in international markets would have grown 20%, then we subtract off like 15 points of growth, eight weeks, over 52 weeks is like 15%, so then just assume there's like a 15-point headwind to international growth next year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. When you think about the new customer dynamics, unusual environment, but I'll give commentary, I guess what I've been saying all along, which is we've always expected the competitive conversion opportunity to start to go down over time, probably we'll start a little bit next year just because of the sheer number of opportunities won't be as large as it has been up to now. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
