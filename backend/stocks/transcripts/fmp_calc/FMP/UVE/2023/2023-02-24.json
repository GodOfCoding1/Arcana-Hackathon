    "content": " Adjusted diluted earnings per common share was $0.72, up from diluted adjusted loss per common share of a $1.53 in the prior year quarter, with the increase mostly attributable to lower net loss in expense ratios and higher net investment income and commission revenue. Core revenue of $326.4 million was up 11.3% year-over-year, with growth primarily stemming from higher net premiums earned, net investment income and commission revenue. Direct premiums written of $416.1 million were up 4.2% from the prior year quarter, including 3.6% growth in Florida and 6.8% growth in other states. The 76.3% net loss ratio was down 27 points year-over-year, with the decrease primarily attributable to a lower current accident year net loss ratio and lower adverse prior year reserve development. But absent Q4 weather and excluding a margin that was generated by handling claims, we're very close to the current accident year loss pick that we had booked up through the third quarter, which was in the 47% range. So we're really pleased with the work that was performed by these teams to mitigate costs associated with handling these claims on behalf of both our insurance entities and our reinsurance partners, we handled about 90% of these claims, and we've always believed that we can service our business with more care than any other third party."
