    "content": " Total revenue of $287.5 million was up 9.4% year-over-year, with growth primarily stemming from higher direct premiums earned, commission revenues and net investment income, partially offset by higher unrealized losses on equity securities. So one of the sort of big picture questions I\u2019ve got on the Florida market and Universal in particular, is this concern that the rate need in general is way above what citizens can take every year and that you\u2019ll have sort of an environment where a relative basis of your competitors, including citizenship would -- what -- would get sort of relatively more attractive because they\u2019re going to be relatively more underpriced if inflation accelerates."
