    "content": " Core revenue of $301.6 million is up 8.7% year-over-year, with growth primarily stemming from higher direct premiums earned, net investment income and commission revenue. The 72.3% net loss ratio was up 7 points year-over-year, with the increase mostly attributable to a higher initial accident year attritional loss pick associated with the current Florida claims environment and inflationary and weather trends, partly offset by lower adverse prior year reserve development as a percentage of net premiums earned."
