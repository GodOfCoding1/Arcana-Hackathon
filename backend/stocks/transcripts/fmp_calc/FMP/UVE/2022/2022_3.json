    "content": " Despite our $1 billion estimated gross loss from Hurricane Ian, we have a $3 billion reinsurance tower in place for a subsequent event in the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season and our consolidated retention would be meaningfully lower, highlighting the strength and breadth of our catastrophe reinsurance program. We started the planning process for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season and are already well underway, as we have almost $400 million of pre-negotiated multi-year capacity below the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attachment point, approximately $200 million of estimated cost free coverage from the Reinsurance to Assist Policyholders program and a projected $150 million from our catastrophe bond. Adjusted diluted loss per common share was $2.27, down from diluted adjusted earnings per common share of $0.63 in the prior year quarter with a decline mostly attributable to a higher net combined ratio associated with Hurricane Ian, partly offset by higher net investment income and commission revenue. Core revenue of $316.7 million, was up 10.5% year-over-year with growth primarily stemming from higher net premiums earned, net investment income and commission revenue. Direct premiums written of $500.7 million, were up 15.6% from the prior year quarter, including 16.3% growth in Florida and 12.7% growth in other states. The 113.7% net loss ratio was up 42.8 points year-over-year with the increase primarily attributable to the retained losses associated with Hurricane Ian in a higher attritional initial accident year loss pick, partially offset by better prior year reserve development."
