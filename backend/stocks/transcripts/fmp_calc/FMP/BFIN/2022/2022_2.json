    "content": " Your line is open. Right now we're working through the usual underwriting processes which take a little bit longer than they used to, between appraisal and title and environmental and things but we have good pipelines going into the second to the third quarter for multifamily. And then going forward on those pipelines, I would say generally, our goal is for third quarter, we'd like to see if we get the loan portfolio to $1.175 billion . If the corporate department and commercial finance continue to grow their pipelines, then I could see us pushing north of that, but $1.215 billion, $1.225  billion we consider that a pretty good year, anything north of that would be a great year for us. Your line is open. Your line is open. So that's why we're not necessarily saying we're going to have $60 million or $70 million of growth per quarter because we don't know that real estate is sustainable at the level it was in the second quarter, but it still should contribute. But I will also say that given where we're trading as a discount to book, I would think it would be predictable to see us get more aggressive here even in the third quarter and get that share countdown to 13 million for example, because of where we're trading. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
