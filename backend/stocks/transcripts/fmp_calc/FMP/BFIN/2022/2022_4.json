    "content": " That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the -- those are the areas that we are going to spend the most time and focus on and given relative returns from various asset classes, the equipment finance side and the commercial finance side make the most sense, so most of the marketing attention, expansion attention will be in the equipped finance side and the commercial finance side. So, if multifamily and commercial real estate were $5 million to $10 million growth, equipment finance was somewhere between $30 million to $50 million for the year and then C&I was 30% on the low side to $75 million on the high side that gets you a range of up to 10% at the end of the year. And then in commercial finance, as we mentioned last quarter, we will have about $60 million coming off of the securities portfolio this year, at an average of 2.66%. Can you just remind us, I think, you said, it was not or one was over 9.5% maybe as a commercial, but on the equipment finance side, just kind of what you expect to be -- just trying to understand the pickup you are thinking about getting here? So we would expect there to be some additional growth in reserves, both because of the day one impact of CECL and as we pivot the portfolio further to equipment and commercial finance, you will see some higher provisioning."
