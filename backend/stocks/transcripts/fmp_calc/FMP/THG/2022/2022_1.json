    "content": " In the first quarter, we also sustained our auto frequency benefit at a similar level to the fourth quarter of 2021, and we believe this benefit should continue to soften the impact of increased property severity within personal lines, albeit at a potentially lower level as we go through the year. Additionally, we continued to leverage our customer service center capabilities to help our agent partners lock in renewal business at very high levels in spite of their ongoing talent shortages Our Small Commercial business delivered substantial growth in the quarter, up 10.3%, driven by strong pricing and retention, as well as the ongoing rollout of our industry-leading TAP sales quote and issue platform. Specialty current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes was 54.3%, slightly elevated compared to the first quarter of 2021. Personal Auto current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes increased 10.4 points to 70.4% from 60% in the year earlier period, driven by an increase in severity and to a lower extent, an increase in frequency from very suppressed levels in the first quarter 2021."
