    "content": " Our combined ratio was 96.2%, compared with 94.4% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting higher ex-CAT current accident year losses in Personal Lines, which I will address shortly. Second quarter current year catastrophe losses were $89.4 million or 6.9% of net earned premium higher than our second quarter CAT load due to a few Midwest storms, as well as several smaller events. Prior year reserve development, excluding catastrophes, was favorable in the quarter by $9.2 million or 70 basis points of the combined ratio and stem from workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation, surety, management liability, personal auto and homeowners lines. Personal Lines Auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, increased to 72% from 62.2% in the prior year quarter."
