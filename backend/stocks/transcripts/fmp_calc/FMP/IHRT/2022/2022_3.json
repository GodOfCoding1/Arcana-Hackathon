Within the digital audio group, our podcast revenues, which grew 42% versus prior year, outperforming the overall podcast industry growth of 22% year-over-year according to MAGNA and our digital ex podcast revenues, which were up 15% versus prior year, also outperforming the industry growth of 10% year-over-year according to MAGNA. In the third quarter, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA were essentially flat compared to the prior year, and our adjusted EBITDA margins were 31.4%, our multi-platform group has again demonstrated its resiliency during this economic period, generating adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 30s, which we expect to expand as revenue recovers over the long haul. In the third quarter, we generated $63 million of free cash flow when including the proceeds from real estate sales our adjusted free cash flow was $70 million. We also expect to generate Q4 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $305 million to $325 million, which implies a full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $940 million to $960 million, which will yield the second highest full year EBITDA in the company's history."
