We continue to deliver industry-leading growth in our Digital Audio Group, with revenues increasing 28% versus prior year, and our margin expanding to 31.2%, a 380 basis-point improvement from prior year. Within the Digital Audio Group, our podcast revenues, which grew 60% versus prior year, outperforming the overall broadcast industry growth of 22% according to MAGNA, and our digital ex podcast revenues were up 15% versus prior year, also outperforming the industry growth of 11% according to MAGNA. Multiplatform Group revenues grew by 5% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margins improved 80 basis points year-over-year to 30.7%. While there are certainly some pockets of advertising softness, given the strong positions of our Digital Audio and our Multiplatform Groups with both consumers and advertisers, our industry-leading unified ad tech stack for audio and our unparalleled reach, combined with our focus on necessary cost reductions and our disciplined capital allocation as well as the company's strong free cash flow characteristics, we believe iHeart is well positioned for the future. Digital Audio Group revenues were up 28% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA was up 45% year-over-year. When including the proceeds from real estate sales, our adjusted free cash flow was $127 million, resulting in a very strong adjusted free cash flow conversion of 54%."
