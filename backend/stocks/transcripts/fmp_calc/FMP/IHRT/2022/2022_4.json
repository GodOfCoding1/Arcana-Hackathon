    "content": " This includes the iHeartRadio app, our podcast business, our new Metaverse platform and our leading positions on all major social media platforms with our nearly 300 million followers, which is seven times larger than the next largest audio company and which includes our most recent successful expansion into TikTok, where follower count grew 300% in 2022 to 27 million TikTok users with twice as many user engagements as the next largest audio company. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $316 million for the quarter, in the middle of the guidance range we provided of $305 million to $325 million, and our Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were 28%, a 34 basis point improvement versus prior year. In the fourth quarter, our Digital Audio Group revenues increased 10% versus prior year, adjusted EBITDA was flat versus prior year and adjusted EBITDA margins were 33%. In the fourth quarter, Digital Audio Group revenues were up 10% year-over-year, while adjusted EBITDA was flat, and our Q4 margins were 33%. And I think as you all know, the Multiplatform business, in particular, that we have all high-margin businesses, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like 75% to 80% incremental flow through budget, but at the same time, when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this robust revenue number there, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about in Q1, you get hit on the downside of the margin."
