    "content": " We saw a nice operating profit dollar growth in the quarter, up 14% at $330 million, with a little pressure on operating margin rate at 4.5% due to the pass-through of abnormal inflation costs. And so overall, looking, I'd say, big growth looking forward, but the next year is very strong, and you've heard that from many of our automotive customers to that backlog is high, and we need the supply chain constraints to clear for that backlog to be delivered. Look at how we've done this quarter, look at the guide we've given for next quarter, and it seems that when you're sitting in a fiscal Q1 and you're looking forward at a very strong demand pipeline, you're looking at good - the ability to start clearing supply chain constraints, but you're still hearing a lot of noise from the economy and all the noise around you."
