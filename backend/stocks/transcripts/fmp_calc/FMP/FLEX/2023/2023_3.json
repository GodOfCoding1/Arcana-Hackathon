    "content": " As I look at the fiscal 2025 financial framework we gave you in our Investor Day last year, we said high single-digit revenue CAGR, which will lead to 5%-plus adjusting operating margin in core Flex, which is without Nextracker, with mid-teens adjusted EPS growth getting us to $2.65 for core Flex, and 80% adjusted free cash flow conversion. You may ask your question. So, I'm just wondering as you look at how the business has changed over the last couple of years, how you're going about managing this, so that you can get back to the 80%, because I think that's one of the few knocks on your stock right now is your cash conversion. I would say, first, let's start with, Shannon, that I really feel good about kind of the trajectory change that we're starting to see overall with working capital and how we're managing our customers. But in terms of prioritization, when it comes to capital allocation, I would say, number one priority right now is supporting very strong organic growth, whether that's with some working capital or if it's internal investments or CapEx, very high priority, because we have a very clear path ahead of us for solid top-line growth over the next several years, and we want to make sure that we've funded the business for that. You may ask your question. You may ask your question. You may ask your question. You may ask your question. You may ask your question."
