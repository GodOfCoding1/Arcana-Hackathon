It\u2019s a little bit light of what we talked about in July, but at 4.4% to 4.6%, I would say, nice strong margins above last year\u2019s margins with a $100 million of operating profit growth. I would say, Steve, first, at this revenue that we have done in Q2 of over $6.2 billion, I would say -- and at a 4% revenue growth year-over-year, we\u2019d still be very high compared to most of our peers and compared to what most companies that have such strong hardware composition are doing."
