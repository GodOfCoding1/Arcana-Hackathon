    "content": " Overall, we achieved an 11.3% increase in our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $57.3 million compared to $51.5 million last year. Net sales in wholesale increased $165 million or 11.3% to $1.63 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the favorable impact of inflation, which exceeded 14% in the quarter. The increase in reported operating earnings was due to higher sales and lower supply chain expenses, partially offset by higher corporate administrative costs and LIFO expense, which rose $8 million in the current quarter. Retail sales came in at $667 million for the quarter compared to $609 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 9.5%. This update to our adjusted EBITDA and EPS profitability ranges recognizes the benefits from our supply chain transformation and ongoing solid growth, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tempered by retail margin headwinds and the impact of our Merchandising Transformation investments. And ask you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, consolidate expenses showed good leverage, but as I kind of just sort of parsed through it, it appears to me that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little more skewed towards the wholesale side of the business with obviously throughput has a leverage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 big leverage as well as some of the supply chain expense, although I guess that could go to retail."
