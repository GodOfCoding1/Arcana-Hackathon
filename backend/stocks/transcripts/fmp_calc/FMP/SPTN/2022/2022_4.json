    "content": " The gross profit dollar increase was driven by higher sales, while the rate decline was driven by cycling the higher inflation related price gains in the prior year and an increase in LIFO expense up $5.7 million or 21 basis points. Overall, we delivered $47.2 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, representing a nearly 10% increase compared to $43 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, net sales and wholesale increased $151 million to $1.63 billion, an increase of 10.2% when compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Retail sales came in at $678 million for the quarter compared to $613 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.5%. Our reported fiscal 2022 net earnings were $34.5 million, a decrease of over 50% compared to $73.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Overall, we expect the strong results from this past year to continue into 2023 with net sales expected to increase from fiscal 2022 within a range of $9.9 to $10.2 billion. Our fiscal 2023 guidance reflects total planned capital expenditures in the range of $130 million to $145 million for the fiscal year, which includes investments in both our core operations as well as our growth initiatives. In addition, we will also be cycling $4 million in retail wage investments that were implemented at the end of first quarter last year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open.
