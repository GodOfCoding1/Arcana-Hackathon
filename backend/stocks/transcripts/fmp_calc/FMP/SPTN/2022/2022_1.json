    "content": " Net sales in Food Distribution increased by about $37 million or almost 3% to $1.37 billion in the first quarter, driven primarily by the favorable impact of inflation on pricing. The first quarter reported operating earnings in the Military business of $1.4 million compared to a loss of $5.1 million in 2021's first quarter, reflects improvements in the gross margin rate. Retail net sales came in at $781 million for the quarter compared to $739 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 5.7%. Overall, we achieved a first quarter record adjusted EBITDA of $76.6 million compared to $64.8 million last year. For the quarter, we generated $10 million of cash from operating activities compared to using $31.8 million of cash and operating activities in the prior year quarter. So what we've done is taken that $15 million to $30 million run rate and we've brought the bottom end of that forward by three quarters and raised the total guidance, so for the exit of this year to that $25 million to $35 million range. So we are now -- right now, we are performing internally better than we were pre-pandemic in terms of here's the portfolio goods we've got versus we order and here's what we're going to fulfill on the way out of our business. Just if you kind of back up and look at the -- at the same-store comps of 7.2%, as Tony said, it's largely inflation-driven but there's some moving parts beneath the surface if you pull back the cover with trips and basket size."
