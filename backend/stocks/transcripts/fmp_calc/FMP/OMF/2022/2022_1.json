    "content": " Capital generation was $280 million in the quarter, down 6% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the year-over-year increase in net charge-offs and modestly higher operating expenses associated with an increase in originations and continued investment in our business. As you may remember, in May of 2020, during the height of COVID market dislocation, we issued a $600 million five year bond at a coupon of 8 7/8%  While this bond demonstrated our ability to issue in very difficult markets, it also presented an opportunity to add a callable feature to our bond program, which we expected would give us even greater flexibility to manage our funding in the future. We actually gave you some exposure to it in the last conference call, the fourth quarter conference call, where we showed pricing for higher credit customers and partnerships is well below our average stated yield, but it all - it's still returning 6% of return on receivables. Look, the way we think about the smaller dollar loan is there's a set of customers who maybe can't afford after we do their budgeting and look at what is their cushion or what's their net disposable income wouldn't be able to afford a $10,000 loan with a $250 monthly payment, but could afford a lower loan with $100 payment."
