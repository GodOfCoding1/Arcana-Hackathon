    "content": " Our managed receivables reached $20.1 billion this quarter, up $1.7 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting strong consumer demand and the continued positive impact from our investments in new products and distribution channels. Our policyholder benefits and claims expense for the quarter was $40 million, down from $48 million in the second quarter of 2021, driven by positive year-over-year claims experience across several insurance products including life and disability credit insurance. After tracking in line with expectations throughout the first quarter, segments of lower credit quality, lower FICO customers, concentrated mainly in our 2021 vintages, began to show increased levels of delinquency in May and June amidst an evolving macro environment, specifically persistent and elevated inflation levels."
