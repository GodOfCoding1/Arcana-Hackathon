    "content": " Managed receivables grew $300 million sequentially on the strength of solid consumer demand, a positive competitive environment and continued growth from credit cards and new distribution channel partnerships. Our balance sheet, which we positioned with a long liquidity runway just for difficult markets like today, allows us to book all of the good business that we see and the foundation we are saying with our strategic initiatives including credit card and new distribution channels will drive capital generation growth whenever we merge out of this uncertain environment. And just a reminder, this is -- the non-prime credit card market is a $400 billion market and we've got $100 million of cards that we think will get up to $400 million or $500 million. And I understand you're not doing that now, but maybe you can help us understand some of the components that would make -- some help -- give an idea of where capital generation could come in for 2023, just given some of the headwinds from the card side as you grow that portfolio combined with asset yields coming down a bit just because of lower -- I mean, higher interest rates and tightening of underwriting standards. Keep in mind, as we mentioned that's got a lot of these credit cards in it that we would not book, to think it's more than half of the portfolio at year-end, and that's got delinquency levels that are call it twice what we're thinking about originating going forward. On the in terms of the growth, if you say low to mid-single digits, if I sort of benchmark that at $0.5 billion to $1 billion, we've called out we expect credit card to be 400 to 500 at year-end coming off of 100 base."
