    "content": " Bond markets continued to be very volatile with rates backing up in the third quarter and agency mortgage spreads touching near all-time highs, not seen since the great financial crisis, which you'll recall in in 2008 for a time it was not certain that Fannie or Freddie credit was good. With yesterday's fed action priced in, we deliberately slowed our loan acquisition pace beginning in the first quarter of the year, and at the same time, we've continued to execute securitizations throughout the year nine securitizations and over $2.7 billion of U PB through our swap position and these securitizations we have now effectively locked in 99% of our asset-based financing costs taken together. But if we had invested, let's just say we invested $150 million at the beginning of the third quarter, and let's say that we levered it four times, and let's say that we could earn a, a 15% roe, we might have added $5 or $6 to our distributable earnings, but our book value would likely be down three times that much on those same investments."
