    "content": " Lima One was a continued bright spot for MFA, as they turned in another strong quarter with approximately $600 million of originations. We reported a GAAP loss of $108.6 million in the second quarter, primarily due to unrealized losses on residential whole loans at fair value. Other loan portfolio operating costs, meaning that is not related to Lima One loan origination and servicing was $13.2 million, $2.8 million increase from the prior quarter. Turn to slide eight, we reduced our purchases non-QM loans again in the second quarter to $220 million, down from over $600 million in the first quarter, as volatility in rates and spreads remain elevated. Despite challenging market conditions for loan originators, Lima One continues to see strong demand for its BPL products and had another strong quarter with approximately $600 million originated in the second quarter. We acquired over $190 million of SFR loans in the quarter, all the which originated by Lima One and grew the portfolio by 13% to approximately $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. Just addressing your question on additional sources of liquidity and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite referred to, we do have a significant under borrowing on some of our warehouse -- mark-to-market warehouse loans and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as much as $120 million to $150 million at the end of June."
