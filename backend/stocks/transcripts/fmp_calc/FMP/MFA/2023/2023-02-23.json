    "content": " After printing just one securitization of $235 million of loans in the fourth quarter, we've already executed 3 securitizations in 2023 and a total of over $650 million of loans. The combination of higher rates and our unique ability to source business purpose loans and non-QM assets allowed us to add high-quality credit investments that coupons you've not seen in a long time and perhaps never in the fourth quarter, with the average coupon purchased loans of about 9.5%. We acquired $481 million of loans in the quarter and continue to find the best opportunities in business purpose loans originated by Lima One, where we were sourcing these assets substantially below the cost of purchase from third parties and can efficiently control the credit process. Lima originated a record $2.3 billion in 2022, a 42% increase over 2021 and showed its importance to MSA's balance sheet as Lima One originated loans accounted for about 2/3 of MSA loan acquisitions in 2022. And finally and we talked about this a little bit in the press release, our compensation benefit number in our G&A was about $4 million lower this quarter than our regular run rate and that was due to the finalization of some year-end bonus accrual at both MFA and at Lima One."
