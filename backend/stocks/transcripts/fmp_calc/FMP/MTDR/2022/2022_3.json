    "content": " Well, Neil, if it was up to me, of course we've be -- we'd be there tomorrow, but the way the agencies complain to us, it doesn't make I know they've got the rationale, but they put an emphasis on size and that if we were 200,000 barrels a day, we'd be a better candidate than at a 100,000, even if our leverage ratio was 0.2 as it is now or 0.1 and there's is a two point. We see those opportunities are good, but we also look at the drilling opportunities we have or other act, it's all one big opportunity box and we meet as a group and talk about them, and we don't -- we're not trying to, no one's an empire builder and that's what makes it work. It's Zach, it's a high class problem to start paying taxes now, but I think our guys have really worked hard to make sure they get it, they get it right and that it's the same way on our audit is we try to make sure we do it right so that if we're audited, all the numbers will check out. Just sort of given the, the tightness and the oil service side of things, the, the supply chain issues that, everybody's dealing with globally, especially with steel, it just, it seems like you, you'd probably have to lock in a lot of those are secure, a lot of those services and kind of ancillary services and equipment sooner than maybe in years past. And on the drilling side, we're happy with the seven rigs that we have, both performance and staffing on the drilling side with the seven rigs that we do have with results to steel, with regards to steel, it's another one of those 40 year relationships that we've cultivated and built upon in that history and it comes down to transparency with that service provider and, and the trust that we have with them and that they have with us that, that we are going to say, well, we're do, and to them as well."
