    "content": " And as much like as we get into discussing the seventh rig, it's not like we began the year and said we're going to do a seventh rig, but circumstances came up that this is a very special rig, as Billy will describe to you. So we'll take that on in late September, so it's really here for this year only for 90 days, will help us drill the Rodney Robinson and get those off because we have 19 wells there right now. But when we start growing these next 8, you're going to have to shut in probably 3/4 of those 19 -- 15 of the 19, while you're drilling and completing those wells for safety's sake. We're -- as we acquired some acreage at the end of last year up in our Ranger area, we're very proud to be putting money to work at drilling wells up there in the -- kind of in the original part where the Bone Spring formation kind of got going many years ago. As we mentioned, we're getting that saltwater disposal well drilled now so that we can have -- we can drill some more wells in the Greater Stebbins area in parts of next year. But I think where we spent money, Chris and Billy have made sure that we've gotten our money's worth by having the best caliber rigs, really strong vendors who have done what they've said for us and great execution from people being out on the rigs. The thing that I'm -- probably have the lowest chance on is trying to do a buyback at this time because I just think we've got better uses for the money than just buying back somebody's stock would rather use it to help the company grow more prosperous and more reserves, more assets, more midstream, more quality acreage."
