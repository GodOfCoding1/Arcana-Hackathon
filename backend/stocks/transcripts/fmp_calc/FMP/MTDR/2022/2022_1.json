    "content": " I'd also like to throw in that with Maxcom working with the drilling program, we've also started seeing more and more 100-foot an hour drilling and where we used to be trying to drill a whole lateral with one assembly, now we're drilling curves and laterals and have seen this in each hole size or 6, 6.75 quarters inch hole size, 8.75, 8.5-inch hole sizes, all of doing equally as well and getting up over 13,000 foot with one BHA. And we think it's a great opportunity and it gives us great options, and we don't want to be hasty and going into any one of those options, but be sure we've thought everything out so we can continue to add to the value of Matador and make it more valuable to our shareholders and make sure that we share some of the gains in cash flow we are getting with them and to keep up the good relations that we have with our banks. And again, we're shareholders, so it's spending our own money and we're going to be careful with that and take advantage of this I think unusual time in our business and keep it cash policy. And also want to kind of give a plug for San Mateo in that having the part of what has contributed to the reduction in flaring is the fact that we work very closely with our Midstream partners, specifically San Mateo, in that we -- they are there from day one when we go to turn on our wells, and then also the amount of firm transport that they have and the operations of the plant and the communication that we have between teams really is very helpful in terms of making sure that we always have a home for our gas."
