    "content": " And as you can see, at $4 billion, it's $24 million in revenue, deduct your cost and you basically have what your free cash flow is. And in 2022, it's $233,000 worth of stock and with an 80% increase in the amount of stock being bought back, then I think we're going to see substantially more stock based on the algorithm. Operating expenses for the current quarter were $3.7 million, an increase of $595,000 or 19% over the same period last year, primarily due to the following reasons: General and administrative expenses increased $612,000 or 40%, primarily due to higher fund expenses and higher consulting professional fees; advertising cost increased $94,000 primarily due to the launch of the new ETF. On the next slide, we see our operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, is $2.5 million or a decrease of $775,000 compared to the same period for fiscal year 2021. We see that our other income decreased to $12 million compared to prior year and that is because in the current period, we recorded unrealized losses on investments of $4.5 million compared to unrealized gains on investments of $7.1 million in the same quarter last year."
