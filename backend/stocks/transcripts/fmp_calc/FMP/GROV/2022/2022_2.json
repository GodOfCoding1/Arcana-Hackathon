    "content": " On the flip side, we saw continued positive trends in DTC net revenue per quarter, which was up 3% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter to 58.3%, driven by continuous strength in existing customer average order value, and increased VIP membership revenue per order. Advertising expenses fell 21% year-over-year, and 45% quarter-over-quarter to $17.9 million, reflecting our decision to reduce our advertising spend and focus on improving marketing efficiencies, as we strive to balance spending to support the increasing brand awareness, optimizing customer acquisition and retention, and driving revenues, with our EBITDA objectives long term. The year-over-year increase was predominantly driven by $14.6 million increase in stock-based compensation, due to catch-up of expenses for the company's of retail stock units and certain stock options as a result of meeting the performance vesting condition, when the company went public, partially offset by a decrease in fulfillment costs and lower order volume. Excluding LBT, SG&A expense in the quarter would have been $39.8 million or 8% less than the same period last year and 15% less than the first quarter of 2022. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 1,730 basis points quarter-over-quarter to minus 26.6% but fell by 540 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased SG&A as a percentage of net revenue, higher outbound shipping costs from price increases and surcharges and the slightly lower gross market rate."
