    "content": " For the third quarter, net revenue was $77.7 million, down 18% year-over-year, but down just 2% compared to 2Q 2022. Third quarter net revenue was $77.7 million, down 18% year-over-year and 2% from the second quarter of 2022. Similarly, total orders were down 26% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter to $1.2 million, and active customers were down 15% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter to $1.46 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Partially offsetting the declines in total orders were continued positive trends in DTC net revenue per order, which was up 7% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter to $60.63. Advertising expenses fell 73% year-over-year and 52% quarter-over-quarter to $8.7 million, reflecting our strategic pullback in advertising spend and focus on improving marketing investment efficiency. Excluding a stock-based compensation and severance, SG&A expense in the quarter would have been $36.8 million or 16% less than the same period of last year, and 31% less than the second quarter of 2022."
