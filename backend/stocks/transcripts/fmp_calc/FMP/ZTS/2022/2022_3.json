    "content": " With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Even with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. I think vaccines is an area that you typically see certain supply constraints in and challenges, and I think we'll continue to see those into 2024 and as we exit the year, we'll continue to make progress on Revolution, but it is certainly having an impact on the fourth quarter as well is what I would say. We've made a number of investments across the business, whether you look at what we're doing in R&D, what we've done with respect to our field force, and we'll continue to do across the diagnostics in our pet care field force, for example, in the US, we're making investments across our supply chain and manufacturing, obviously, given the demand we're seeing across our products and anticipated launches of other products out into the future. If you include the impact of generic competition and higher than that without -- but companion animal is where we have innovative products, we continue to see strong demand, and we're taking price to the tune of about 5%."
