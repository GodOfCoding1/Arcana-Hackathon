    "content": " Ending deposits were down 14% from the first quarter and down 10% year-over-year, driven in part by the transfer of a small portfolio of deposits to our retail bank that I mentioned a few moments ago, as well as rate-driven runoff as some customers withdrew deposits in search of higher returns. And if anything, I think the technology transformation and some of the continued choices we've made like dialing back from high balance revolvers and other things has -- and as I said, the whole heavy spender push, I think, has put Capital One and actually an even stronger position from a resilience point of view. And interestingly, if you switch to kind of income, which is a different cut than FICO certainly, and income, I'm struck by the fact that consumers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the wage growth for the lower income consumers is -- they're kind of the one category, the lower income consumers, where their wage growth has been keeping up with inflation, but that won't necessarily continue, but that's also a position of strength. I have in front of me -- I don't think it's the exact thing you're asking, but I have in front of me some growth rates, in fact, finishing growth since -- versus 2019 of a bunch of categories that I find pretty fascinating, but this is not -- this isn't our own mix, but these things in fact mix things, I guess, but gas 90%."
