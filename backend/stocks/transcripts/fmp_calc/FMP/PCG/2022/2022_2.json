    "content": " I will focus on three key areas today: first, our financial results; second, our continued work to build trust with policymakers and play our role as an enabler for California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosperity; and third, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide an update on our wildfire mitigation progress. The amended language in the undergrounding bill provides a supportive framework for PG&E to follow long-term undergrounding plan, which is good for customers and investors, because it allows us to build a more robust plan for labor, the lowest cost contracts and provide the fastest path to eliminating the highest risk and moving reliability at the same time on our power lines."
