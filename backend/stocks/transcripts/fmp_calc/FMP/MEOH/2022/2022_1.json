    "content": " Our consistent track record and commitment of returning cash to shareholders is highlighted and the Board\u2019s decision to approve both a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.145 per share, as well as an increase to our share buyback program for 3,810,464 to 6,094,171 shares, representing 10% of the public float. I\u2019ll leave it there. I\u2019ll leave it there. And just when I think about potential uses maintenance CapEx, isn\u2019t that much your new dividend is, I don\u2019t know, $50-ish million a year, and you can only buyback, call it another 100 million, 150 million or so shares through September under the current bid. But if the LNG market today is at $17, $20 MMBtu and Europe\u2019s going to wean itself off of Russian gas, it\u2019s going to come from LNG. So I think unless something was to change with the directions of both Russia and Europe, it\u2019s going to be tough for not only methanol, but for ammonia and nitrogen and a lot of things that rely on natural gas. I\u2019ll leave it there."
