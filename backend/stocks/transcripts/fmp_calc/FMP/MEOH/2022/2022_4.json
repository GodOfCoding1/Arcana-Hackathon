    "content": " We continue to monitor the macroeconomic and energy price environment, we see potential demand upside from the reopening in China, following the Lunar New Year given the significant methanol demand in China, as well as in Asian countries with strong economic ties to China. I was very surprised that through China's lockdown last year, we didn't really see that thermal coal price drop a lot and so the methanol -- the marginal cost of methanol held in really well. DME, we don't see demand growing there, that's sort of what I'll say is sort of a mature application not seeing investments in that space, but it's sort of steady demand, above 4 million tons of demand per year with a lot of growth rates on that."
