    "content": " I mean we had starred in 65% of our needs in North America, whether it's on fixed price or pure hedges, and those were out of the money for six years, and we're getting criticism, we should have bought spot gas in a couple of quarters of what's happened in those hedges are now in the money by quite a lot. But directionally, as much as much product as we can keep in the Atlantic Basin, that would be our preference, especially in the current freight environment, where fuel prices are so high, it's very -- it's like a $50 advantage to keep the product and just not freight alone to keep the product in Atlantic never mind that the net backs are better as well. Well, higher fuel costs this time last year, right, so if you look quarter -- year-over-year, and every quarter where we send product based on outages, based on where we think the optimizer global supply chain in an environment where you're paying higher for fuel, it gets exasperated a little bit and that's what we saw on the quarter. So, if we do run at higher than minimum rates, spot gas would be a good proxy for -- the gas price for the 35% that's not hedged, but that's assuming we're going to not go to minimum rates. And I think that's the reason is that their flex fuel, so they're not going to be stuck into one, one fuel, they'll be able to switch back and forth from methanol, marine gas oil, ultra-low sulfur diesel, provided the environmental regulations are such that allows them to run diesel or NGO. And based on our current outlook from our customers, and from what we're seeing in the marketplace, we still expect the demand to be quite solid, remind you as well, there's two idle MTL plants in China that have the ability to restart and the whole dynamic on the ethylene and propylene chain."
