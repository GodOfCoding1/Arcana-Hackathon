    "content": " As you can see, our adjusted diluted earnings exclude adjustments totaling $0.09 related to a number of items: first, the impact of mark-to-market changes in commodity hedging instruments, a gain of $0.06 this year versus $1.09 in the prior year; adjustment for a $0.05 gain on foreign currency derivative instruments; $0.01 of expense associated with the corporate functions transformation in comparison to $0.07 in the prior year for all the business transformation initiatives; $0.02 of expenses related to restructuring costs, which is largely attributable to a reduction in workforce and the related costs. This is driven by our robust strategic assets and integrated asset portfolio, including pipelines, gathering systems, natural gas storage and LNG, that positions us well to meet the energy needs of customers today and in the future and provides a competitive advantage to deliver sustained growth; strong underlying demand for the energy solutions that we offer; new investments including Mountaineer and UGI Moraine East that have expanded our earnings and cash flow capacity; the long pipeline of opportunities to invest capital in a regulated utilities business in jurisdictions that provide an attractive return on equity; a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to meet capital needs; and our dedicated employees who are committed to doing the right thing each and every day."
