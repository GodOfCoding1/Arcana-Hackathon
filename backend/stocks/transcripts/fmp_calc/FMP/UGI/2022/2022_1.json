    "content": " AmeriGas despite seeing promising customer growth in several areas reported lower overall volumes due to weather, the impact of customer service challenges from the prior year after establishing the new operating model and the effect of higher commodity prices on customer usage. Our Natural Gas businesses delivered strong results, despite the warmer weather, due to incremental earnings from Mountaineer, the higher gas base rates that went into effect last year and higher margin from renewable energy marketing activities.
