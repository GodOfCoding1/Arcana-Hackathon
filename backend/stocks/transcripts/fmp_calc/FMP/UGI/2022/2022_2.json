    "content": " For the fiscal second quarter, UGI reported adjusted EPS of $1.91, and our reportable segments delivered adjusted EBIT of $631 million, which was fairly consistent with the prior fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, we expect adjusted EPS for fiscal 2022 to be within a revised guidance range of $2.90 to $3 inclusive of the effects of margin management and expense control actions implemented in the first quarter, and we expect to see benefits throughout the year. Global LPG experienced higher LPG margins and implemented strong expense control actions, which partially offset net volume loss at AmeriGas and the impact of significant increases in volatility in commodity prices on the UGI International energy marketing business. Now for the quarter, AmeriGas reported lower retail volumes, a $33 million impact to margin when compared to the prior year. As Roger mentioned, we expect adjusted EPS for the fiscal 2022 year to be within an updated guidance range of $2.90 to $3, largely due to the impact of warmer than normal weather and the significant increases and volatility on commodity prices particularly within our international energy marketing business in the first half of the year. We expect to recover nearly half of the loss by the end of this fiscal year, mainly due to price increases now in place to reflect the heightened commodity price and volatility, margin shift due to price backwardation and cost control actions taken within that business."
