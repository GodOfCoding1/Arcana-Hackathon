    "content": " These results reflect the robust performance of our natural gas businesses including the effect of weather that was colder than the prior-year period, higher gas base rates at UGI Utilities and continued growth from our UGI Appalachia assets. At a high level, Global LPG was up $0.02 due to effective margin management and strong expense control efforts, which offset the effects of significantly warmer weather in Europe and continued inflationary pressure, particularly in personnel-related costs. Total margin increased by $20 million, which was primarily attributable to higher retail propane margins, and this was partially offset by the effect of lower volumes. Lastly, the $25 million increase in EBIT was due to higher operating income partially offset by lower other operating income as our buy-in of the Pennant assets allowed for discontinuation of equity method accounting given that the assets are now fully owned by UGI."
