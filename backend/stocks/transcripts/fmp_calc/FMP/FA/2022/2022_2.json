    "content": " This is on top of the significant revenue growth we experienced in 2021, including the 38% growth in the second half of 2021.We also anticipate continued incremental flow through from our increased revenues and expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $254 million to $259 million. So as we said earlier, we grew 10.5% organically in the quarter, 15.3% in total, 16.6% on a constant currency basis and $9.6 million of that was from our existing customer base, $8.8 million were from new customers and $8.3 million from acquisitions; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty consistent with our long-term targets. Our model that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve communicated all along is really kind of base growth between 2% and 4%, upsell cross-sell between 4% and 5%, new logo between 5% and 7%, backing  15.3% in total, 16.6% on a constant currency basis, and $9.6 million of that was from our existing customer base, $8.8 million were from new customers and $8.3 million from acquisitions."
