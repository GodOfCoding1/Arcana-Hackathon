International revenues in Q1 of 2022 were $31.7 million, up 91.6% from Q1 2021 with 45.5% organic growth and represented 17% of total consolidated revenues in the quarter. In the first quarter, revenues from our existing customer base contributed $33.9 million to our year-over-year growth. Revenues from new customers contributed $9.1 million to our year-over-year growth, showing strong momentum on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 46.5% to $53.6 million, reflecting higher revenues and year-over-year margin expansion from ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies, automation, use of proprietary databases and G&A leverage. We now expect to generate full year 2022 revenues in the range of $820 million to $835 million, representing approximately 15% to 17% year-over-year growth."
