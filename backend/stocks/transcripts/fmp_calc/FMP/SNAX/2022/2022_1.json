    "content": " Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, we have reduced net losses by almost 40% to $7.3 million in the first quarter and improved negative adjusted EBITDA by 41% to $6.3 million compared to $10.6 million of negative adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of last year. Based on investor feedback this quarter, we have reverted to our traditional earnings press release format, instead of presenting information in a shareholder report, so that investors can easily track our recent operating results, financial position, and cash flows against prior periods by providing easier access to financial tables, including the income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA. And when we compare our Q1 performance to Q4 of last year, we see that even with only modest sequential sales growth in the quarter, we significantly reduced our net loss by 39% and similarly reduced the negative adjusted EBITDA by 39% compared to the fourth quarter."
