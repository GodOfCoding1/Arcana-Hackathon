Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start with the with company presentation, which is then followed by questions-and-answer sessions led by me and the other covering analysts. Thank you, Jesper, and welcome to this second quarter 2022 earnings call also from my side. Today, joining me in this presentation is our CFO, Fredrik Nihlen, and I will just in a minute give the word to Fredrik. But before we go into the main part of the presentation, I would like you to take a moment and read the following legal disclaimer.

Prospective investors are advised to carefully consider these various risks, uncertainties and other factors. The company believes such information is accurate and that the sources from which has been obtained, these information are reliable. And with this, we move on to the main part of the presentation and we have a short agenda today and Fredrik please come up and present Q2 2022 financial results. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I will summarize the financial results for Q2 2022, and you can find the details on our webpage neonode.com under Investors section and in our 10-Q. License revenues decreased this quarter due to mainly that our customers has component shortages and cannot produce products with our technology and hence, we get lower revenues. During 2021, we saw an increase in demand for products or TSMs, and they were included in retrofit solutions. And we can also see that product developments, new product developments take longer time sometimes up to 18 months or longer that impacts our products revenues negatively. And if we look at adjusted margin for TSMs, we can see an increase and then positive trend. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mainly due to lower staff expenses, but also lower depreciation and amortization costs. Coming to cash, we had a net cash burn of $2.9 million in Q2 2022. For the first half of 2022, we invested in our inventory to secure production of our TSMs, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to have any more large investment in inventory during the rest of the year. That gives us a cash and accounts receivable balance of $13.5 million as of June 30, 2022. Let me also say this, that also from my side, I think sales and the overall results for second quarter this year are below expectations and we work hard to change this in the coming quarters and the coming years. And those are you that follow us and have joined the previous earnings call, you will recognize some of this. But our business model rests on two pillars, technology licensing, where we work with two technology platforms, one called zForce, which is a advanced optical technology platform suitable for touch, gesture sensing, and object detection applications. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a software platform for scene analysis that we are, for instance, applying in automotive applications for driver and in-cabin monitoring. For the licensing business or the solutions business, the target is clearly on two segments printers and automotive. The second pillar is product sales, where we today offer a range of touch sensor module products and I will describe them later. In 2020, 2021, we developed overall strategy for the company that we are still executing on and that we are believing is the right strategy. You can call it a three step approach for growth, focusing on marketing and sale, creating awareness and demand. This year, we have really started to focus more on the key markets, including Japan, South Korea and China. We have also been working to expand our customer offerings, both for licensing and we are working currently to expand our customer offerings, also in the products business with more vertical integration, we can offer more software content for instance, and we are working also new product concepts at the moment. We are also returning to the investigation of outsourcing the TSM production, and we are actively looking for a second source to complement our own production in Pronode in the West Coast of Sweden. And in the third step, we think that from beginning next year, we will more actively and aggressively pursue further targets like expanding the business scope, new market segments, and maybe some new product offerings. Within our business model, we work with licensing, we work with product sales and we also offer engineering services typically as fixed price commitments. We see big potential to grow all three revenue streams and the biggest potential in the coming two years, three years, we believe is with the products business. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stronger lever, if we can achieve higher sales volumes in the products business than if we do the same with the licensing. Still, the licensing has potential to grow, but then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a more in the medium and long-term aspect, because typically when we work with customers, for instance, in automotive, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long development cycle before we can earn more royalty revenues from the licensing. And on the other hand, during that development period, we can earn NRE revenue, so non-recurring engineering revenues. And we are actively working since a couple of years on this, and we have actually several project ongoing that look promising and that bring NRE revenues and Payway for future licensing. So overall, potential in all three revenue streams, short, medium-term biggest potential for growth is to grow the products business. And what all these products, we call them touch sensor modules or TSMs. They feature our zForce reflective technology, and we carry them in 11 different links and in two main variants. We have chosen in our new strategy to focus on contactless touch applications, where we think we have a unique offering and can bring a lot of value to different types of applications. The other one is to align the light field from our sensor with a projected image that you can get from a holographic display, which are becoming more and more popular and we see a quite strong traction in this segment and this technology combination of a holographic display with our TSMs. And just to illustrate concretely how this may look, here is a typical kiosk application, a retrofit solution developed and installed by our partner Happymeter in Singapore. This is from Hamad Airport, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a typical check-in kiosk that they have converted the normal touch interface to a contactless touch. Very neat works perfectly and for the airport company, in this case, it also limits the investment they need to make conversion. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to replace all the kiosks, they can do a simple retrofit, which literally is done in minutes. And if you go online on YouTube or LinkedIn and Google a little bit with Happymeter, you will see several films from them, where they demonstrate in real time, how quick it is to install a solution like this on a kiosk. I talked about holographic displays, and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example how it can look, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite futuristic. Here, a solution is a patient monitoring device and the patient data is projected into midair and the nurse or the doctor can interact with that projected image through our touch sensory modules that are installed in the base of this plate here. And we see a lot of interest in this, as I mentioned. Overall, our technology has many application areas, different types of kiosks and elevator applications in different segments. And this pace wave for a very, very interesting business case. And for contactless touch today, we focus on three main segments, transportation, retail, hospitality. And if you focus for one moment on transportation, of course, we want to communicate that are different ways to use contactless touch to create a safer and better user experience, when for instance, entering an airport or going into a train station. So our job here, what we are working on is to inform, educate, persuade, motivate, inspire, and we are doing this in different ways with digital marketing and also online events and other types of campaigns. So let me move on here and say that within transportation, we have had an \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are still having a strong focus on aviation, meaning typical airport applications and in particular people movement in airports. And if you have followed us or if you want to visit our website or check us out on social media on Twitter, you will see evidence of this. What we have done in terms of campaigns and advertising to generate interest to inform, educate, inspire, and simply generate leads and drive sales. We also have worked on infographics like this, and personally, I think this is quite interesting and useful to study a little bit more in detail. Because it shows, for instance, at an airport, the relevance of Neonode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touch sensor modules and our technology and the value we can bring to users at different points from the parking lot when they drive up with their car and want to park their car. You can interact with different types of kiosks, ATMs, vending machines and so on. And even inside the aircraft, we see strong use case for Neonode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touch sensor modules in the panels or for the cockpit personnel or the passengers. And this is something that we pushed in particular before this event, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest airport event you can say it. And in our booth, we had several of our partners and customers, also co-exhibiting. We had a team in place that promoted this from Neonode side, and we had at least four or five other companies actively promoting this throughout this show. Following this event, we want to go further with some of our partners. And one example of this is with our value-added reseller, MZ Technology in France. They have big plans to expand into the Middle East, and we have recently signed a new agreement with them to expand their region that they can operate in to also include the Middle East. And in particular, now we have lately started to focus more and more on driver and in-cabin monitoring, and also all the detection  for head-up displays. And as I mentioned before, we have already started to work on a couple of serious projects, thanks to this work that we have been doing during the spring. So coming then to quickly to our concluding remarks, to summarize our presentation at this call, I want to repeat that also from my side sales and results for Q2 in this year, they were below expectations. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly affecting their industry and their domestic markets, but we see that several customers and partners, especially now in Mainland, China and Korea, they have serious problems overall, just surviving. Most other markets have now in August, started to open up and start to return to normal. Fredrik mentioned semiconductor shortage, which is a problem for several of our customers, both printer customers and automotive customers. And in some cases, also these companies we work with interactive kiosks and elevators. I will underline that this is not a serious problem for Neonode, actually for our own production. And we are also working closely with Texas Instruments who supplies the key component that we use in all the licensing and also components we use for the touch sensor modules, special application specific integrated circuits, ASICs. But we see in automotive, several customers report and that they have issues elsewhere holding back their production of new vehicles and then generating lower sales volumes for us and lower royalty revenues, same with printers. We hope and we, I see signs that during the third, fourth quarter this will be sort of remedied because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard pressure on the semiconductor companies to increase capacity. And I can also say that from Texas Instruments, we have clear reports that demand for their integrations circuits that only Neonode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license customers can buy is on a good level and a good stable level. And this means that probably there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clear demand out there, and we hope that we have a sort of rebound during the rest of the year and maybe into next year. In some cases, it depends on these lockdowns and other effects now macro effects, uncertainties high interest rates and so on that affect also these customers though, they hesitate to launch new products or really to kick off new developments. But we have several large corporations in Asia, for instance, that have really developed product that we worked on for two years now, but they then hesitate to launch them because they feel that the timing giving the overall macro condition in the market is not right. So there are different reasons why sales continues to be a little bit slow, but overall, we see a stable and increasing demand for our touch sensor modules and not least driven by the interest that we see for holographic display solutions. And to create the holographic effect here, you need unique holographic plates as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re called. So to create these solutions, these are the two key components that everyone will need. For the touch sensor modules, everyone will have to buy from Neonode and we like that situation. I stand now in August and say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m even more uncertain that we are on the right track regarding this. Overall, we remain optimistic about our prospects to grow and improve cash flow both during the rest of this year and the coming year, obviously. Again, I repeat that we work in elevators and interactive kiosks. In elevators, we have had good success in the first years to secure customers and partner developing retrofit solutions. What we are now working on and seeing that we have more than two, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say it like this elevator OEMs developing like new equipment solutions including our technology and they are quite different. They are meticulous in their development and testing, and before they release something to public, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all double checked and triple checked. We are growing the market share for retrofits, and we are starting to dig into the new equipment part of that market. For kiosk, it has also been a race in the previous two years with retrofit solutions, but here we have a more fragmented market segment than elevators, extremely fragmented, I would say. And also in Europe, we have a couple of examples where we have big OEM customers doing now their own retrofit, but also in parallel developing for the next generation of the same products, integrated solutions. And some of these customers are Fortune 500, if not Fortune 200 companies. For instance, I went to see some of these customers in Japan before the summer. And we hoped, and we are, of course, encourage them to speed up and launch this now because it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if some of these big names come out with new products featuring our TSMs, we think it will have a positive effect also on other discussions we are having. You have to be focused and be persistent and work hard, and then some are close to launches and some are further away and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole spectrum. Also, you remember, we talk about both elevator and kiosk market in using a pyramid picture. We knew it, of course, up front, we are doing everything we can to push them, to motivate, to inspire, show other examples. And we are here very much supported by our different partners and the existing customers, because we are all having the same objective with this and we are working well together, I would say. So in some cases, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already clear, other suppliers have already been nominated. But what I think we are seeing, and what we are riding on right now is sort of the second wave and this fits in with our strategy from the beginning. So we have developed a software platform, which is very, very flexible, easy to adapt to different requirements and combine, for instance, driver monitoring with in-cabin monitoring, different in-cabin monitoring features with the same solution and adapt very quickly. So now, even OEM customers and Tier 1s that have already sort of decided, when we approach them and show a little bit what we can offer them, we get often very, very positive response, because they have tried other even well known and highly praised solutions from others. And then in some of these cases, we are then hook latching on and starting to have a growing relationship and developed and concepts and solutions. And the launch is later on, depends on their product launch plans, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few years out unfortunately, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way the automotive industry works. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also technically very nifty, so we are quite enthusiastic. So one last question to Fredrik, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of macro uncertainties both regarding like inflation and also big FX movement. Of course, we can perhaps see a bigger push next year for employees that say that inflation is high and we want salary raise also. But overall, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that is the main issue, but we can see a main impact is in the currency effect because our cost base is basically in SEK in Swedish Krona. So basically that your cash, which is in U.S. dollars, that will last a bit longer."
