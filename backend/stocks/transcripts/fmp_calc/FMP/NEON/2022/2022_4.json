And also in Europe, we have some good customers and partners that we were able to get new businesses with and together that gave a very positive end to the year for the products business. We have also decided to develop some new product variants to broaden the portfolio, because we think that we have established now some good sales channels in different markets that we can use to sell additional products through the same channels, sometimes our direct sales efforts or via partners. Thank you very much."
