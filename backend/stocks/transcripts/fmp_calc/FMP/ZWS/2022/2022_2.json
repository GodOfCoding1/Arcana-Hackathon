    "content": " Given the highly complementary nature of the combination, products also sold to the same customer, same end markets with the same go-to-market approach, we thought there to be a significant opportunity over time to leverage the Zurn Elkay Business System to drive a broad amount of synergies initially targeted at $50 million across SG&A, manufacturing and supply chain and finally 80:20. With respect to margins, we expect our Zurn Elkay adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding corporate costs to be between 21% and 22% in the quarter, which result in 100 basis point to 200 basis point expansion year-over-year when you pro forma the third quarter of 2021 for Elkay."
