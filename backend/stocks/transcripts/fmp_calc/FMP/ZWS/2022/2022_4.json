    "content": " By improving the attachment rate and continuing to grow the installed base, we're confident that filtration can be $100 million of high-margin recurring revenue in the coming years, as we expand accessibility to provide subscriptions and embed and proprietary technology to ensure that we're getting the replacement event. For the full year, we are projecting consolidated Zurn Elkay sales in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion and our consolidated adjusted EBITDA to range from $325 million to $345 million resulting in a year-over-year margin expansion of at least 110 basis points up to 170 basis points. And so, I think the framework around guidance really puts a premium on just executing at a high level to start the year worked through that high-cost inventory and then obviously get the synergies from the Elkay transaction that we're highly confident in, and we're starting the year with the range of $325 million to $345 million. And Elkay synergies, think about relatively flat over the course or I should say consistent -- with the course about $25 million, let's start with that $6 plus million in Q1, a couple of things got to get done in this quarter, but then kind of getting back to that little over $6 million cadence over the balance of the year to equal of the $25 million. So, the way to think about what we're focused on is really that drinking water piece, but also the leverage we're getting out of having this broad portfolio that we have sort of unrivaled the ability to specify that spec it -- pull it through it's an advantage for building owners, it's been a hit with the wholesale community and we're really excited about that first turn of traction we're getting with our newly instituted third-party rep network."
