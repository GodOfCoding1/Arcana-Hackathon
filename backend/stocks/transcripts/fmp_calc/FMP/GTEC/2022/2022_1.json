    "content": " This demand will continue to grow as additional legislation is passed introducing a stricter environmental governance policy requirements, such as the upcoming SEC at NASDAQ environmental reporting requirements, and new consumer incentives, such as Maryland's recently passed Clean Cars Act of 2022 that offers a state grant to subsidize 20% of the purchase price for electric industrial heavy equipment such as ours. We achieved 19% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter to US$29.3 million, with 19 percentage year-over-year net income growth and a 30% increase in our cash balance. Total operating expenses increased 33% to US$3 million, as we continue our investment in pursuing higher revenue levels and target long term growth. But in closing, I just want to emphasize that the first quarter of this year was a very strong quarter for us for agreement with 19% year-over-year revenue growth, a 19% increase in net income and a 30% increase in our cash balance."
