    "content": " Now Q2 has been a challenging quarter for the company with $20.6 million in revenue generated, representing the first quarter where we did not produce positive year-over-year growth since we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ in 2019. If we take a step back and view our first half results, then you will see that the slight losing a month of sales opportunity due to these COVID restrictions, we are still on pace with last year's performance with $49.9 million in revenue compared to $52.8 million in 2021 and $5.6 million in net income this year compared to $5.3 million in the last. Even with the short-term challenges, we drove a 330 basis point expansion in our gross margin year-over-year to 23.5% during the period and further enhanced our balance sheet with $10 million in proceeds from Registered Direct and Private Placement Offerings in July. As a result of our strong supply relations, combined with the lower sales volume, we were able to reduce our cost of goods sold by 8% to $38.7 million, and we generated gross profit of $11.2 million, up 4% from $10.8 million in the first half of 2021."
