    "content": " Our adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $54 million, down $7 million compared to last year, a decrease of 11% and adjusted operating income was $39 million, a decline of 16% versus the prior year, with adjusted net income at $26 million we delivered $0.78 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, down $0.19 or 19% from the first quarter of 2021. To provide more color on the adjusted net income, the first quarter decreased $6 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the impact from the headwind created by supply chain constraints and high direct labor absenteeism from the January COVID-19 surge, partially offset by the addition of Oscor on a year-over-year basis."
