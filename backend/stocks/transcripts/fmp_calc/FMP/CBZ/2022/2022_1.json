    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA generated in the first quarter was $92.9 million, an increase of 26.7% over $73.3 million in the first quarter a year ago. Looking ahead for the balance of 2022, consider that the first quarter increase in total revenue compared with prior year was greatly enhanced by the impact of the mid-year acquisitions made in 2021, plus the impact of Marks Paneth that was acquired in January of 2022, with all acquisitions contributing 20.7% to revenue growth in the first quarter. With the balance of the year is expected to reflect continued strong results, but at this early stage, it is not yet clear that the 9.6% seasonally strong first quarter growth can be sustained at that same rate throughout the full year. So with these factors in mind, I can reiterate our full year expectations for 2022 as follows: We expect revenue growth to be at the higher end of the range of 19% to 21% growth expected in total revenue over the $1,104.9 billion total revenue reported in 2021. Adjusted to eliminate first year transaction and non-recurring integration expenses at Marks Paneth, we expect adjusted earnings per share in 2022 to grow within a range of 20% to 22%, for $1.99 to $2.03, compared with the adjusted $1.66 earnings per share reported for 2021. Within the Benefits and Insurance, within the 6.9%, there's some portion of that, that was contingent revenue that we received in the first quarter that won't continue through the rest of the year, but we're predicting a continued strong growth rate within that group for the rest of the year."
