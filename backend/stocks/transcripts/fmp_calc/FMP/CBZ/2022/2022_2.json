    "content": " Total revenue in the second quarter increased by $83.3 million, up 29.9% over second quarter a year ago. The second quarter same unit revenue was up $31.7 million or up by 11.4%, with acquisitions contributing $51.6 million or 18.5% to growth compared with last year. For the six months this year, total revenue grew by $174.3 million, up 30.1% compared with last year. Same unit revenue for the six months grew by $60.5 million or up by 10.5%, with acquisitions contributing $113.8 million or 19.6% to revenue growth for the six months this year compared with last year. Bear in mind, as you look at earnings per share for the second quarter and for the six months, a year ago in the second quarter of 2021, we adjusted results to eliminate the impact of the $30.5 million settlement cost, plus we eliminated the $6.4 million gain on the sale of operations that was recorded in the second quarter last year. With these items in mind and with a view towards presenting meaningful comparable information, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter this year is $0.63, up 26% compared with adjusted earnings per share in 2021 of $0.50. Adjusted EBITDA, considering these same types of adjustments, was $148.6 million for the six months this year, up 27.9% over adjusted EBITDA of $116.2 million last year, and we expect a similar full year increase this year."
