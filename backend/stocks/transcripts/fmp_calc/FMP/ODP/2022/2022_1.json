    "content": " Our revenue performance remained healthy and the powerful combination of our low-cost model approach and flexible supply chain and pricing strategies, along with customers recognizing the breadth of products to serve their business, education and home office needs helped to drive strong operating results against this more challenging backdrop in the quarter. BSD's revenue performance improved in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year, driven by stronger traction in our contract channel as more businesses begin to return to the office and to in-class learning. Total revenue in BSD was $1.2 billion in Q1, up 9% in the quarter relative to the same period last year, driven by an increase in sales in our contract channel as businesses began to return to the office. When eliminating the impact of store closures, we estimate sales for open stores were approximately flat with last year as our value proposition continue to resonate as we provided strong support for home office, education and small business customers. I would just add, Chris. I would just add, Chris."
