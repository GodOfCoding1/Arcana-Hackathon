    "content": " We will begin today's call with Gerry, who will provide an update on the business, focusing much of his commentary on our accomplishments in the quarter, including our operational performance and the progress we are making on all of our initiatives to continue driving shareholder value. Overall, I'm extremely enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for our business and how our Better Together strategy and business unit realignment has us positioned to drive growth and value for shareholders in the future. We have witnessed the highest inflation in over 40 years as well as sourcing and supply chain conditions that continue to be impacted by higher fuel costs, supply chain constraints and higher labor costs, while the lingering effects of COVID continue to have an impact on the nature of how people work. While these conditions are having an impact to our business, I'm very proud of our team for once again remain focused in delivering solid performance, consistent with our preannouncement of preliminary results while also advancing the foundation of our new business unit structure. We accomplished this performance by remaining true to the core tenants that drive our business, driving a low-cost model, expanding our value proposition and moving into higher-value businesses to pursue new avenues of growth. As reflected in our results, we're executing along these priorities leveraging the strength of our business model and the flexibility of our infrastructure to address the market demands. We continue to drive our low-cost model, providing compelling value for our customers and helping us generate solid operating results. We're also remaining flexible to serve customers in new ways, whether at home or in the office and expanding our value proposition by continuing to provide a broader set of products and services. Under new leadership in ODP Business Solutions, we're enhancing our disciplined focus on profitable growth, driving improved results as more business customers return to the office. And lastly, our B2C business continues to meet our customer needs as a home install business office superstore and we are making great progress in positioning this business for continued success. Consistent with our preannouncement, we delivered solid operating performance in the quarter despite the industry-wide challenges related inflation and supply chain constraints. Our top line revenue performance remained healthy and our low-cost model approach, combined with flexible pricing and distribution strategies hope to drive solid operating results despite the more challenging backdrop in the quarter. As we announced in June, after reviewing alternatives for our consumer business, and considering current market conditions, our Board of Directors unanimously determined it is the best interest of the company and its shareholders not to divest the consumer business or pursue a public company separation at this time. That said, we've made progress in aligning our operating businesses into our B2C business and 3 distinct B2B businesses. There is still work to be completed to fully operationalize realignment but soon, these changes will enable us to provide greater visibility into these operating businesses and their performance on a go-forward basis. With the realignment, we will be able to provide clarity and economic performance at each business unit and give our investors the opportunity to understand our value drivers more directly, which should lead to greater shareholder value over time. We're advancing our digital platform business, Varis, receiving positive feedback from our private preview launch on the Microsoft platform and making progress on adding new customers and suppliers to the ecosystem. We're also making progress on solidifying the foundation for Veyer, our logistics and supply chain business, enhancing our supply chain capabilities and aligning our assets to support our captive B2C and B2B businesses today and leverage existing and new customers to drive accelerated growth in the future. This year will mark an important milestone for Veyer as we move closer to launching the business, and we continue to expand our data-driven platform to support our current and future routes to market. As evidenced by these actions, we're reinvesting the business while also returning capital, highlighting our team's commitment to creating shareholder value. The reduced store footprint and lower traffic resulted in lower sales year-over-year in our Retail division, which was offset by stronger sales in our Business Solutions Division as we continue to see improving back-to-office trends in the quarter. In all, our compelling customer value proposition, combined with our team's strong execution helped us drive approximately $54 million in adjusted operating income in the quarter and strong EBITDA results. BSD's revenue performance improved in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year driven by stronger traction in our contract channel as businesses continue to return to the office. We saw improved demand among private enterprises and education customers through our contract channel, partially offset by lower sales to our e-commerce channel related to lower demand for certain product categories previously in higher demand during the pandemic. Demand for core supply categories, copy and print services, workspaces and technologies showed strong performance, partially offset by lower sales of cleaning and breakthrough products relative to last year. Adjacency categories including workspaces, technology, cleaning and breakroom as well as copy and print remained at 44% of total BSD sales in the quarter. From an operating perspective, our operating income versus last year was up about 45% as we execute upon our low-cost model approach inflect our distribution assets. We're also announcing a new President, David Centrella, a company veteran to lead the new ODP Business Solutions and are excited by the positive impact he's already had on the business and team members. I'm extremely proud of our retail team for continuing to drive a positive shopping experience, leading to continued strong Net Promoter Scores above 70% among the best in the industry. Our revenue performance in the quarter was lower versus last year, partially driven by fewer stores and service as a result of planned store closures as well as lower traffic trends in the quarter, which were partially offset by stronger sales per shopper as well as strong omnichannel sales in the quarter, supported by our 20-minute pickup guarantee. From a product perspective, an increase in demand for copy and print services was offset by lower sales of cleaning and PPE products, supplies as well as technology and PC products, which were negatively impacted by supply chain and sourcing challenges. The number of out-of-stocks in the quarter continue to run significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, most notably for technology products and PCs driven by the continued chip shortages as well as overall challenges for components, including certain ink and toner. In the quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiative of further aligning our assets to support our B2B and consumer businesses, forming the foundation of our 4 business unit strategy. Through the process of analyzing the assets that control our business and how to leverage these capabilities, we've continued to make progress on aligning these assets to support our go-to-market strategies in our B2C, B2B, digital platform and distribution businesses. These efforts have helped us develop a clear line of sight for each of these businesses and the strategy behind driving future profitable growth, which we will share more at Investor Day. And during the quarter, we continue to separate the operational components of our business that are necessary as we build unique routes to market to support business customers and consumers. And while we still have some work to complete on this path in the coming year, we have mostly completed our strategic realignment, which has resulted in forming 4 highly focused operating businesses, reenergizing our teams all under our holding company structure. This includes a contract sales channel of our BSD division, including our Federation Entities, comprised of the regional office supply companies we acquired over the past few years, targeting under some geographic areas as well as granted toy serving commercial contract customers in Canada. Next up is Veyer, created through our separation process and is a world-class supply chain distribution, procurement and global sourcing operations, supporting both our B2B and B2C businesses as well as logistics need for other third parties in the future. Wrapping up my comments and before I turn the call over to Anthony, I want to thank all of our team members for performing at such a high level while navigating all the macroeconomic uncertainty and as the company undertook a strategic review of our B2C business. As you heard earlier, the sourcing and supply environment remains challenging and inflation remains at its highest level in over 40 years, creating additional cost pressures not only for us but for nearly every company and consumer. These costs and sourcing challenges have continued into the second quarter, impacting our cost of goods sold, supply chain and labor, particularly as we build up inventory for the upcoming expected strong back-to-school season. Accordingly, our supply chain cost to serve was up approximately 100 basis points in the quarter compared to last year due to higher transportation and container costs, as well as higher third-party logistic rates and labor. And while we are beginning to make sourcing progress in certain areas, the highest challenge areas continue to be in certain technology product categories, including PCs, printers and ink, causing our overall out-of-stocks to be higher than normal. We generated total revenue of just over $2 billion in the second quarter, 2% lower than Q2 of last year. We again saw improving back-to-office trends during the quarter, helping us drive stronger performance in our enterprise contract channel both year-over-year and sequentially. We generated stronger sales through our contract channel in core supplies, cleaning and breakroom, copy and print categories, partially offsetting the lower sales of technology and in categories primarily related to the supply chain challenges I mentioned earlier. Our retail channel again drove solid operating performance, providing strong support for hybrid workers, education and small business customers. GAAP operating income in the quarter was $28 million, slightly down from $30 million last year. Included in operating income was $26 million of charges, consisting primarily of $23 million in costs largely related to our separation activities and the remaining $3 million is associated with noncash asset impairment charges primarily related to the company's retail store locations. That being said, these costs also greatly facilitated our ability to stand up our B2C, B2B and Veyer routes to market, and we expect to continue efforts to fully operationalize all elements of our business unit structure across our platform. Year-to-date, we incurred $32 million of restructuring and separation costs associated with our refocused route to market, and we anticipate additional separation costs as we fully streamline the structure. Excluding these and other items, our adjusted operating income for the quarter was $54 million compared to $43 million in Q2 of last year. This includes adjusted depreciation and amortization expense of $34 million and $36 million in the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding the after-tax impact from the items mentioned earlier, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $39 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $33 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the year period. Operating cash used in the quarter was $114 million, which included $14 million of restructuring costs. Lower operating cash flow in the quarter was primarily related to the timing of working capital items, including inventory, which I will speak to in a moment, timing of trade payables as we source certain products with tighter terms and the natural buildup of accounts receivable as we continue to see stronger BSD sales. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $21 million compared to $16 million in the prior year period, reflecting targeted growth investments in our digital transformation, supply chain and e-commerce capabilities. Adjusting for cash charges associated with our separation and restructuring plans in the quarter of approximately $14 million, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was a use of $121 million. As shown, these segments are ODP Business Solutions, our enterprise contract business; Veyer, our supply chain and procurement business; Office Depot, our omnichannel consumer business; and Varis, our digital platform business. One of the primary changes I would like to highlight is our e-commerce business which is currently largely reflected in our BSD segment will now be reflected in our consumer business going forward, building on the omnichannel capabilities we have today, which will be leveraged even further in the future. And finally, Veyer which today, its operations are embedded and allocated to both our retail and BSD segments will become its own segment as they continue to support the supply chain needs of our consumer and B2B businesses and pursue new third-party relationships to further optimize the assets and our capabilities. Total revenue in BSD was $1.2 billion in Q2, up 6% in the quarter relative to Q2 of last year, driven by an increase in sales in our contract channel as businesses began to return to the office. This was partially offset by lower sales velocity in our e-commerce channel, which we expected, relative to the stronger demand experienced last year during the heightened conditions related to the pandemic. For total BSD, we saw stronger demand for core supplies in certain adjacency categories, including cleaning and breakroom, furniture and copy and print services, helping to offset lower sales in technology categories. More specifically, in our contract channel, sales for core supplies categories were up approximately 9% year-over-year, highlighting the strong correlation between return-to-office activity and core supplies growing in the mix. Total ad categories, which are products outside of our traditional office product suite generated about 44% of total BSD revenues and remain an important component of the overall value proposition and product basket for our customers. That being said, our e-commerce channel continues to be a key component of our omnichannel presence, providing our customers with the convenience and ease of shopping online and to help fuel our strong and growing BOPIS offering with those sales reflected in our retail business. BSD's operating performance continues to improve significantly over last year, generating operating income of $45 million in the quarter, up about 45% over last year. I would add that the work we started a few months ago, utilizing our data-driven approach and performing line level reviews of customer contracts is helping us identify margin opportunities in the business, meeting customer demands in the most efficient way. Our Retail division again drove solid operating results in the second quarter, continuing to provide a strong value proposition to our home office, education, consumer and small business customers. Reported revenue in the quarter was down 11% to $811 million, driven by 71 fewer retail stores in service this year versus last year, related to our planned store closures and lower store traffic. From an operating perspective, we continued to deliver solid operating margin performance in the quarter despite the higher cost challenges. We generated operating income of $46 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to last year. Operating margins were slightly just under 6% of revenue, up about 90 basis points compared to last year as continued cost efficiencies and SG&A, product mix, pricing strategies helped to offset and mitigate higher product and supply chain costs. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength, ending the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of $417 million in cash and cash equivalents and $953 million in availability under our asset-based lending facility. Adding this to our open market share repurchases last year, we have returned over $300 million to shareholders since Q2 of last year. For the year, we are expecting consolidated revenue in the range of $8.45 billion to $8.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $430 million to $460 million, adjusted operating income in the range of $285 million to $315 million and adjusted earnings per share of $4.10 to $4.50 per share. We've executed well in the first half of the year, driving solid results and making significant progress on aligning our assets to support our four-business unit strategy for the future. Our strong balance sheet, diversified route to market and long-term free cash flow conversion profile has positioned us with the ability to launch our tender offer and continue to invest in our business, while remaining in a position to continue to enhance shareholder returns over time. Operationally, our team will remain highly focused on executing across our business, working to mitigate cost pressures, and utilizing our data-driven approach in our contract channel to drive profitable growth while delivering upon our consumer plan. And we think that from a valuation perspective by unleashing these other 3 areas, we're going to have a bigger valuation opportunity with our traditional B2B business, the ODP Business Solutions, which Dave Centrella will run. And we think our supply chain business as well as our various digital platform business, I'll make a few comments on that. And then obviously, we'll continue to evaluate the future where value opportunities are, but we think at this time, with the economic conditions we have, these 4 businesses are best to stay integrated intact. So as we looked at the four BU strategy and we looked at the opportunities afforded by the four BU strategy that drive further economics as well as the transparency that we will be providing through the four BU strategy, we felt that this is the best opportunity that over time should allow us to continue to command a multiple expansion in each of these businesses, which today doesn't afford us based on the transparency that the further alignment will provide. SG&A dollars declined $13 million year-over-year, recognizing a portion of that is due to the savings associated with the lease expense from closing stores, but you are making sizable investments in other areas of the business that would require some incremental operating expense dollars. We've done a tremendous job over the last 4 or 5 years, and Tim can get into more details and specifics offline, but of taking tremendous amount of cost out of this business. I think we've done a really good job of balancing that plus, we've also done a good job of, we think, in the last couple of years, especially of returning capital to our shareholders as well, $300 million last year."
