    "content": " We began the first fiscal year with an excellent first quarter, as both segments of our business delivered solid growth leading to total revenue growth of 16%. GastroPlus revenue increased 19% year-over-year this quarter, we had 16 new 100k plus customers in the quarter, and nine new small biotechs pharma companies, CROs and incubators. Our PK/PD services revenue this quarter increased 4% as the relatively high number of project disruptions that impacted the business during the second half of last fiscal year, are returning to normalized levels. Our software gross margin was 90% for the quarter, up from 87% last fiscal year due to increased revenue and slightly lower cost of revenue. With regard to a couple of key service metrics, total service projects increased 48% this quarter and we ended the quarter with $15 million in backlog, up $3 million from the prior year quarter. PK/PD side turned the corner and improved in terms of their growth rate, but probably lags in terms of the increase in sales activity and backlog growth compared to the other 2, but we're seeing a pretty full pipeline right now in that area that anticipate will contribute to more success in the second quarter from their rebound. I mean overall, after a couple of quarters of negative growth service side getting to 13% growth in the first quarter is a very good sign and gives us confidence as we move into the remaining parts of the fiscal year '22."
