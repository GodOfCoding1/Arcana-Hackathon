Fourth quarter capped off a good recovery in our services business with 13% growth and finishing the year with a backlog of $16 million, 22% greater than the end of last year. Our revenue outlook for the fiscal 2023 remains consistent with our long-term organic growth rate of 10% to 15%, which translates to $59.3 million to $62 million. From a quarterly perspective, we expect Q1 revenue to be about 20% of full year revenue and Q2, three and four to be more evenly distributed for the remaining 80% of revenue. Total gross margin for the fiscal year increased to 80%, reflecting the higher software revenue mix. Software gross margin increased to 91% from 88% last year, while services margin increased to 63% from 61% last year. Regarding key services metrics, total services projects increased 8% this fiscal year compared to last year, and backlog increased 22% from $13 million last year to $16 million. Income from operations increased 299% to $0.7 million and operating margin was 6% compared to 2% last year, reflecting the leverage in our business model. Income tax benefit was flat from last year at $0.1 million, while the effective tax rate decreased from negative 74% to negative 8%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $2.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million or 18% margin last year.
