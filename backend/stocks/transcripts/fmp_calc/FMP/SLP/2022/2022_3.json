    "content": " Overall, our services backlog continued to grow, increasing 34% during the quarter, providing further evidence that the challenges and disruptions in the second half of last year are behind us. Total revenue growth rate was 17% in the quarter, comprised of 16% software growth and 19% services growth. Software represented 64% of revenue during the quarter, which continues to be above our 55% to 60% fiscal year guidance. Our total revenue growth rate was 15% year-to-date, with software growing 20% and services growing 8%. Software gross margin was 92% for the quarter, up from 90% last fiscal year due to higher revenue and leverage from the cost of revenue line. Regarding key service metrics, total service projects increased a robust 50% this quarter compared to last year, and backlog increased by approximately $5 million from last year to $17 million. Income operations increased 9% to $4.9 million, and operating margin was 33% compared to 36% last year, reflecting the quarterly timing and increase in operating expenses. For our year-to-date net income -- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, for our year-to-date income statement, total R&D costs year-to-date were $4.7 million or 11% of revenue compared to $5.1 million or 14% of revenue last fiscal year. SG&A expense year-to-date was $17.4 million or 41% of revenue compared to $15 million, also 41% of revenue last year. And operating margin expanded to 34% from 30% last year, reflecting increased revenue, expense management and the leverage inherent in our software and services mix. We came out this year with a 10% to 15% guidance reflected certainly a lot of momentum on the software side of the business as we came into the quarter, but service business that ramped out the fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009821 into fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009822."
