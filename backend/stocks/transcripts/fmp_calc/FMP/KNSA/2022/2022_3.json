    "content": " We're very pleased with the continued momentum of ARCALYST in recurrent pericarditis, the third quarter of 2022 was strong with an ARCALYST net product revenue of $33.4 million, representing 24% sequential growth. Specifically of the 33 patients who continued rilonacept treatment beyond 18 months, only one subject experienced a pericarditis recurrence at 23.4 weeks into the long-term extension and this event was associated with a treatment interruption of four weeks. As you heard from Sanj Q3 represented yet another quarter of consistently strong growth driven by patient identification in recurrent pericarditis, which led to a quarterly growth of 24% or $6.4 million and resulted in a Q3 net revenue of $33.4 million. And for those patients who chose to stop initial therapy, whether of their own volition or from a belief of having come to an end of their disease duration, around 35% went on to restart commercial therapy, the majority being within eight weeks from when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stopped ARCALYST."
