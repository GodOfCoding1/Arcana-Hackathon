    "content": " Radware Global Management is making a $35 million investment in SkyHawk, and together, we intend to scale and strengthen SkyHawk's position and unlock even more security value for customers. Revenue in the first quarter grew 10% year-over-year, driven by our cloud and product subscription business. We started 2022 on a high note with 10% growth in revenue for the first quarter 2022, reaching $73.7 million in revenue compared to $66.8 million in the same period of last year. Total ARR increased 9%, reaching $192 million in the quarter and was also driven by cloud and subscription ARR, which grew 20% year-over-year. First quarter 2022 revenues in the Americas totaled to $29.5 million, a decrease of 12% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased by 9% to $51.7 million compared to the same period in 2021 due to additional head count, including security and personnel joining our R&D team, and related costs as well as increase in marketing and travel costs as COVID impact decreased. As we highlighted in previous calls, the decline yield on marketable securities and the positive impact on financial income, which decreased from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $800,000 in the first quarter of 2022. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter 2022 increased 11% year-over-year to $0.19, resulting from the gross and operating margin improvement."
