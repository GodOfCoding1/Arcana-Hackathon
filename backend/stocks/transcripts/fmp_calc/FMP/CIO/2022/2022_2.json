    "content": " After quarter end, we have come to terms with two tenants that we expect will backfill approximately 49,000 square feet at the property and we have over 10 months of lead times to find replacement tenants for the balance. The largest single item to impact AFFO was $1 million of tenant improvement expenses related to the new 73,000 square foot tenant at our Tower Property, which took occupancy during the quarter. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 contributing $500,000 to that decrease, BB&T vacated their space at Park Tower during the third quarter of 2021 to accommodate the new 73,000 square foot tenant. One other thing I just want to highlight is offsetting these known move-outs, we do have signed 292,000 square feet of new leases that will be taking occupancy over the next year, which includes that 49,000 square foot tenant at 190 centers completed after quarter end, which will help offset these known vacates. So really, the total number that we were anticipating was $2.8 million at the beginning of the year, and therefore, the change in guidance for this quarter and an additional $600,000 and that relates to that tenant of that 190 office property, which I mentioned, 44,000 square feet, who have exercised their termination option in March, and they are expected to vacate in March of 2023."
