    "content": " Year-to-date, net absorption across our nine markets is negative 3.9 million square feet, vacancy has continued to edge higher across our cities and we expect elevated levels of subleasing and downsizing we will continue to put pressure on occupancy rates in general. When you are looking at the page 15 of the supplemental, the lease expirations over the next four quarters and matching those expirations and the known move-outs there versus the stuff that you have signed, what does that look like in terms of sort of net flow of space in terms of space you are getting back without a tenant versus stuff that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently unleased that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to wind up starting to pay rent. But just as a reminder, if we are successful in leasing up that full 170,000 square foot of spec suites that I just talked about, I mean, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potentially another $4 million of NOI. And then beyond that, we have a healthcare company at 190 Center that will be downsizing by 130,000 square feet at the end of June and we have a 34,000 square foot tenant at our Papago Tech property in Phoenix that was expected to depart at the end of July 2023 and so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all of the large known vacates over the next four quarters. It -- based on 2023 and our assumption that interest rates will continue to rise here with the next Fed meeting and potentially beyond and the decrease in occupancy that we have discussed earlier on this call, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really 2024 and beyond where we are going to see ourselves kind of back to dividend coverage and it will be this period of time here, similar to the last three quarters where it will be a shortfall."
