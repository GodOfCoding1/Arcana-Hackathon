    "content": " Today, we're in various stages of lease drafting with over 25,000 square feet of potential new tenants with two of these being smaller retail tenants, which will enhance the overall experience at the property. At Block 23 and Phoenix 77,000 square feet of new tenant leases have commenced since the end of last quarter, increasing occupancy from 62% to 87% at March 31. First quarter, Same Store cash NOI was impacted by lower occupancy year-over-year, contributing $500,000 or half of that decrease BB&T vacated their space at Park Tower during a third quarter to accommodate a new 73,000 square foot tenant. And what trends that has turned into is some shorter-term leases and some smaller space requirements and we think that's going to persist over the short term, but what tenants keep telling us is they want great quality space to lure their people back."
