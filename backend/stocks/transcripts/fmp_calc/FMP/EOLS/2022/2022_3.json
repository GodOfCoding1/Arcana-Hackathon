    "content": " First, we are reiterating the top end of revenue guidance for the year, coming off of a very strong quarter of growth, where we believe our unit market share is now approaching 10%. Global net revenues for the third quarter of this year were $33.9 million compared to $26.7 million a year ago, which was a growth rate of 27% and driven almost entirely by higher volumes. In the third quarter, net cash used for operating activities was $17.1 million, which was $3.8 million less than the amount used in the second quarter, and a continuation of the favorable trend we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen this year keeping us on the path to achieving sustainable positive cash flow."
