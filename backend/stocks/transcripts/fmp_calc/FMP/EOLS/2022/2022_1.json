    "content": " First quarter sales grew to nearly $34 million, reflecting continued year-over-year share gains. The first quarter marked the first full year since our relaunch and we cannot be more pleased with the rapid uptake of Jeuveau across the U.S. From an expense standpoint, we continue to softly manage our overhead costs and are investing in greater share of resources in brand building through our innovative co-branded marketing program or CBM. As David mentioned earlier, net revenues for the first quarter were $33.9 million, up 177% from a year ago when sales were impacted by the ITC proceedings. The major changes from last quarter included a combined $23 million of settlement and net royalty payments, $12 million of inventory payments to support the growth of the business and interest payments of $2 million with the remaining $2 million of cash used to operate the business. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses of between $135 million and $140 million, which consists mainly of continued investments in the growth of Jeuveau in the U.S. plus new Nuceiva launch expenses in Europe."
