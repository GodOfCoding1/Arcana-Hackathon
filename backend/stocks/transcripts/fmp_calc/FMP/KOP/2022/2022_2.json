    "content": " On slide 8, consolidated sales for the second quarter of 2022 were $502.5 million an increase of $61.5 million or 14% compared with $441 million in the prior year. And sales for CM&C, increased by $48.8 million or 48.8% compared to the prior year quarter. On slide 9, second quarter adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis totaled $54.6 million or 10.9%, compared with $65.6 million or 14.9% in the prior year quarter. Sales for RUPS were$ 204.2 million compared to sales of $195.5 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to pricing increases across all markets especially crossties and utility poles. As shown on slide 11, performance chemicals had record sales of $149.6 million compared to sales of $145.6 million in the prior year quarter, driven by global price increases for copper-base preservative, partly offset by year over year decreases in volume for preservatives primarily in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals decreased to $20.4 million from $34.5 million in the prior year quarter, as margins reflected higher raw material costs and higher cost inventory working through the system in a falling copper price environment. CM&C saw adjusted EBITDA of 21 million, compared to $18.6 million in the prior year quarter due to a favorable demand and pricing environment. Net leverage ratio was 3.8 times a quarter in compared with 3.3 times at year end 2021, reflecting in part a working capital usage of $54 million in the first half of the year. We're beginning to catch up in some areas, and recouping our higher cost and are tracking well above our targeted $10 million price increase for 2022, although much of that has gone to cover even higher cost than we anticipated coming into the year. However, since RUPS is behind where we had expected them to be heading into this third quarter, we're reducing our expected level of adjusted EBITDA improvement in 2022 to $12 million compared to the $18 million we were projecting back in May. In PC, we're showing an expected $16 million adjusted EBITDA decline from their record prior year, partly due to their softer Q2 results and partly due to the projection of the same moving forward."
