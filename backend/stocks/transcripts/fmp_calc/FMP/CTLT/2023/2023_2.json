    "content": " We expect consolidated non-COVID revenue growth for the remainder of the fiscal year to be more in line with the Q1 levels, which was more than 20% on a constant currency organic basis, as we address our large backlog of non-COVID work, particularly in our gene therapy and drug product offerings, and our PCH business returns to growth. However, as we get into the second half of the year, we have line of sight, which is very typical at this point in time to have strong visibility to adjust the remaining five or six months that we have in the fiscal year from those volumes, so expecting to see non-COVID growth in the second half more in line with what we saw in the first half, again, in that 20% range, and that will bring our full year non-COVID-related growth to be in the mid-teens as I mentioned on the call. Those would be the main contributors that we would see to the change in organic non-COVID-related growth in the second half of the year, and we were able to still hold our guidance range and pull back around the assumptions on the PCH side of the business, where, as we mentioned, we continue to see some pressures, particularly when it comes to discretionary spend on the gummies and, I would say, just Nutraceutical products across both Softgel and gummies in the second half of the year."
