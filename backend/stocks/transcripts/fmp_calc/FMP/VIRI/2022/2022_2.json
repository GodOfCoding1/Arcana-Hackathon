    "content": " First and foremost, I'm exceptionally pleased to report that under the expert leadership of our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mike Gendreau, in July 2022, just one month ago, our final patients completed their 16 weeks of treatment in our landmark 425-patient Phase 2b fibromyalgia clinical study. If the forthcoming IMC-1 fibromyalgia Phase 2b FORTRESS data anticipated next month, are consistent with the data that emerged from our successful Phase 2a study, we believe our novel antiviral combination, IMC-1, could be a game changer for the millions of patients in the fibromyalgia community. And we would expect data from the program to read out some time in the first half, hopefully quarter one, but certainly possible since we don't control the pace of the recruitment here, could be quarter two of next year, and hopefully with good news there, that could catalyze a second very important program, one that could be, frankly, as large as the existing fibromyalgia program. In short, we hope to change the standard of care for fibromyalgia patients worldwide if the data from our ongoing Phase 2b FORTRESS trial are consistent with the data we've already generated from our previously completed Phase 2a program."
