    "content": " First off, I'm pleased to report that under the expert leadership of our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mike Gendreau, our research team has now recruited 425 patients into our landmark Phase IIb fibromyalgia clinical study, also known as FORTRESS. Once we have those data in hand and have both the efficacy and the safety data in hand, we think that's the opportune time to get down to FDA, not just to talk to the analgesic division about a Phase III program for fibromyalgia, but also would be the opportune time of both efficacy and safety data in hand at the doses used in the Phase IIb trial to engage with FDA about requirements for a Phase IIb or Phase III program for IBS."
