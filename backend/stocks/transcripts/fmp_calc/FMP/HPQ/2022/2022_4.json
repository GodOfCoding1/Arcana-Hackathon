    "content": " In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.5 billion, down 7% nominally or 6% in constant currency, driven by lower Supplies revenue and lower home hardware units combined with increased pricing competition in the home business. Supplies revenue of $2.7 billion declined just under 10% in constant currency, slightly better than expected as demand weakness appeared to stabilize in the quarter. This program is expected to run for three years, and we expect to generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '25. We expect Print margins for FY '23 to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range, driven by the resiliency of our portfolio and disciplined pricing and cost management including our transformation efforts to reduce our print fixed cost structure, as Enrique mentioned. And also, we expect specifically in Q1 just due to the fact we've got this combination of both the unfavorable business mix from the top line pressure of Personal Systems, you combine that with the bonus payout and restructuring and with the increase in AR from contract manufacturers, which is partially offset by continued reductions we're taking at inventory level, we expect that our cash flow in Q1 is probably likely to be negative towards breakeven."
