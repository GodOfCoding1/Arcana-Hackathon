    "content": " And then just to sort of reiterate the point that you made around Personal Systems revenue, as we said earlier, due to the record revenue, the Russian situation and the continuing supply challenges that you\u2019ve heard Enrique talk about, we do expect Q2 PS revenue to decline high single digits sequentially. And then if I could just follow up, either Enrique and Marie, but when I think about the full year guide that\u2019s been raised right now, you\u2019re sort of implying 12%, 14% EPS growth, I think, for fiscal 2022. So, I\u2019d just say that we\u2019re confident that we will see the total of Print and PS operating profit dollars, that they will increase year-on-year for the full year 2022, though I would just point out, it\u2019s probably going to vary quarter-by-quarter. I think it\u2019s also important to highlight that within the Personal Systems side, we continue to see very high growth opportunities in the growth area that we have identified on both gaming, peripheral, workplace solutions are really growing in a very strong way, which also gives confidence in our ability to continue to grow in a sustainable way. And for my follow-up, I think this might be more for Marie, but the PS margins, I think, for the quarter, you mentioned you\u2019ll be \u2013 once we exclude the partner benefits, you\u2019ll be at the high end of the range that you specified, 5% to 7%."
