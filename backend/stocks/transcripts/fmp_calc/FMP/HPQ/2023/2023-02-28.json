    "content": "  Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2023 and HP's other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory. Since our Q4 call last November, the macro volatility we described has continued. By doing what we said we would do, we delivered on our Q1 EPS guidance and we are reaffirming our full-year outlook. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on three areas. I will then cover our business unit performance, and I will conclude with our outlook before handing the call to Marie. This reflects industry-wide headwinds, including corporate budget tightening that has started to impact large enterprise demand. Despite this topline pressure, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.75. This is in line with our previously provided outlook, and it reflects the actions we are taking on cost as well as discipline execution on pricing and mix. In terms of costs, our teams have done an excellent job, reducing spend and driving efficiencies. Collectively, our key growth businesses grew double digits in Q1, including Poly. For example, new hybrid work models are fueling demand for peripherals and other collaboration solutions. In addition, we launched our new Poly Voyager wireless earbuds, with three mics per earbud they deliver higher quality voice transmission and audio experiences. Last year, we created our Workforce Services & Solutions organization. We delivered healthy WSS revenue growth in Q1, and we drove margin expansion by shifting more of our mix to digital services and achieving cost efficiencies. For example, our HP workstations and data science stack is accelerating machine learning and AI workflows, which is leading to the creation of a new category of high-performance PCs specifically designed for data science and AI applications. And this quarter, we also created a new organization focused on consumer subscriptions. Let me now touch on our business unit performance, starting with Personal Systems. At the market level, we continue to see soft demand in consumer and commercial. Against that backdrop, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion. PS operating margin was better than expected at 5.4%, and we grew operating profit sequentially. We accelerated the growth of our Hybrid systems and PS services businesses, and we remain focused on growing profitable share. In calendar Q4, we grew share sequentially in the high-value segments we have prioritized. Current market conditions are more stable, and we see different dynamics playing out by business. In supplies, the situation in Q1 was better than expected and we continue to see strong adoption of profit upfront and subscription models. The commercial print market is being impacted by macro uncertainty, corporate budget tightening and the uneven pace of return to office. Within commercial, office printing has seen improvement as the supply situation normalizes. Taking all this into account, our Q1 Print revenue was $4.6 billion. Our office hardware revenue grew 13% year-over-year or 5% sequentially, and we gained share in office quarter-over-quarter in calendar Q4. Although return to office is uneven, the pages per device remain in the range of 80% of pre-COVID expected levels. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in Instant Ink, surpassing 12 million subscribers. Industrial graphics and 3D were impacted by macro headwinds, with revenue down year-over-year. This quarter, we expanded our Jet Fusion lineup and we drove adoption of our Metal Jet solution with key customers such as John Deere and Schneider Electric. Across our business, sustainable impact remains at the core of our strategy and our leadership on important topics that climate change, human rights and digital equity is building trust in our brand, and it's helping us win new business. It includes the world's first PC with recycled coffee grounds, which are used in the finish of the device. We have also reduced the product packaging, so we can ship up to 66% more units per pallet. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, and we are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time, unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. Given the volatility of the market and our growing contractual business, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we moderated our share repurchase activity in Q1 as planned while maintaining a leverage ratio within our target range. Looking ahead, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect our second half performance to improve relative to the first half, driven by our cost-saving measures and as the improved channel inventory levels create a more normalized pricing environment. The PC market in units may regress to pre-COVID levels in the short-term, but we expect it will remain at a structurally higher level with more premium and high-value mix. As we said last quarter, we expect the overall print market to be down low-single digits this year. And as I said at the top of the call, we are maintaining our full-year financial outlook. But we are taking decisive actions as part of our Future Ready plan to improve our performance, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver. And by maintaining investments in our growth priorities, we are strengthening the company for the future. As Enrique said, we continue to focus on what we can control and deliver on the commitments we have made. In Q1, we remain disciplined in rigorously managing our costs and investing strategically while delivering on our outlook. We are adapting quickly to the current environment, but see continued opportunity to drive further improvement in our cost structure and operational execution. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 19% nominally and 15% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 16%, EMEA declined 15%, and APJ declined 13%. Gross margin was 20.3% in the quarter, up 0.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to improved commodities and favorable print mix, partially offset by competitive pricing, including currency. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by lower variable compensation, rigorous cost management and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by the Poly acquisition. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 28.3%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $183 million, up primarily due to higher interest expense driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.35 or 32% to $0.75, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $262 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, debt extinguishment costs and other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49. We are now reporting revenue by business capability, consumer and commercial versus our previous disclosure by product category, which better aligns with how we think about and manage the business. The composition of our consumer and commercial business capabilities remains consistent with what we have outlined in the past, with the exception of Poly, which is now included in commercial. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion, down 24% or 20% in constant currency, with FX headwinds as expected. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial, driven by soft demand and a tough prior year compare. And while commercial constituted about 60% of our units, it represented approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter. With that, combined with improved supply availability, pricing competition intensified incrementally in the quarter. Within Commercial, these were partially offset by favorable mix. During calendar Q4, we improved our go-to-market execution and grew our overall market share sequentially. We also increased our market share in high-value, more profitable segments, including commercial, desktops and notebooks. Our focus continues to be on driving profitable share growth, especially in the premium segment of our consumer and commercial markets. Our margin declined 2.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency headwinds, increased promotional pricing and favorable prior period R&D partner funding. This was partially offset by Poly contributions and lower costs, including variable compensation and commodity costs. In Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and growing our NPV positive units as well as the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. Hardware revenue was relatively flat, driven by favorable pricing actions in Commercial, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing actions. Industrial Graphics and services revenue declined slightly, reflecting emerging demand weakness in the enterprise space. Total hardware units increased 2% as component availability and logistics constraints improved sequentially, augmented by better-than-expected China demand. By Customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 2% or 5% in constant currency, with units down 8%. Consumer printer demand remained soft in the Americas and EMEA regions, driving incremental promotional activity as supply constraints continue to ease. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, declining 7% nominally and 6% in constant currency. Print operating profit was $870 million, essentially flat year-on-year and operating margin was 18.9%. Operating margin increased 0.8 points driven by pricing actions and cost improvements, partially offset by promotional pricing of favorable currency and higher commodity costs. The cost improvements were largely due to lower variable comp, expense management and transformation savings. In Personal Systems, we are targeting structural savings by streamlining our portfolio to better target customer needs. We continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our core businesses, particularly in office print and in our supplies, supply chain, including headcount reductions. In addition, we continue to see benefits from our investments to transform our customer support and services organization enhancing our capabilities to provide a more digital enabled customer-centric support experience. Lastly, in January, as part of our Future Ready target to reduce employee headcount by 4,000 to 6,000, we announced a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. I continue to be confident in our ability to drive operating cost reductions consistent with our Future Ready goals, enabling investments in our key growth areas. Q1 cash flow from operations was nominally negative and free cash flow was an outflow of $0.2 billion, in line with our expectations. Additionally, our free cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of receipts and payments related to our factoring program. This increased seven days sequentially, primarily due to an increase in strategic buys driving up DOI and an unfavorable business mix impacting both DOI and DPO. While we decreased our inventory $0.3 billion sequentially in Q1, we have more work to better align our inventory to our business volumes through operational excellence. We will, however, continue to take advantage of economic opportunities like strategic buys, or more seed transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory. In Q1, we returned approximately $360 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $259 million in cash dividends. Consistent with our disciplined financial management and our strategy to prudently manage our leverage profile and maintain our credit rating in the current challenging environment, we limited our Q1 share repurchases to an amount needed to offset share dilution. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY2023, we expect the macro and demand environment will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will remain competitive. We will continue to rigorously manage costs, streamline operations and improve our performance as the year progresses while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. For FY2023, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges I will discuss shortly. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal 2023. Given recent weakness in the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency to be about a 3 percentage year-over-year headwind for FY2023. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.7 billion for FY2023 based on Q1 as a run rate for the year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY2023, with the second half of FY2023 stronger than the first. As a reminder, our FY2023 free cash flow outlook includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash outflows. Specifically, for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will remain under pressure near-term and decline sequentially by a high single-digit. We expect to continue to drive improved mix shifts toward high value, more profitable units and services and expect this will help partially offset the headwinds we've discussed today. But given elevated industry and HP channel inventory levels, pricing continues to be very competitive. For FY2023, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing Future Ready transformation savings. In Print, we expect consumer demand softness will persist and macro uncertainty and corporate budgeting tightening will remain headwinds for commercial. With regard to print supply chain, similar to what we saw in Q1, we expect component shortages will continue to improve, but persist into at least Q2 particularly for office hardware, providing continued support for favorable pricing. Regarding supplies, we expect Q2 revenue in constant currency to decline by a high single-digit versus our previous expectation to be down closer to double digits. Given its variability, we do not believe inter-quarter growth is indicative of our long-term supplies growth. We now expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% range for Q2, driven by continued hardware constraints. We expect FY2023 margins also will be above the high end of our range, driven by disciplined pricing, continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability and rigorous cost management, including Future Ready transformation savings. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2023. And then I have a follow-up. So first of all, something that has not changed this quarter is the weakness that we have seen in the consumer space that we started to talk a couple of quarters ago. Something new, though, has been as we shared in the script, that we have seen weakening demand on the corporate enterprise space as we have seen especially large companies becoming more conscious about how they use their budget, being slowly hiring people, and this has had an impact in the PC side. On the positive side, we have seen reductions of inventory especially that one that addresses consumer and SMB business, the more transactional side of the business, which reflects that end-user demand has been stronger than shipments. Our current view is that we will be getting to a normalized channel inventory situation by the end of Q2, early Q3, which means that in the second half, we will not have this headwind, and this is one of the reasons why we are optimistic about the evolution of the PC business during the year. We think that demand will evolve similar to previous seasonality before COVID, and this is one of the reasons why we expect our second half to be stronger than the first half. I mean look, candidly, we need to be good at doing both operationally and excellent actually and driving value where we see opportunities. So as you've seen, we've been very focused on driving up our inventory turns. And when we see economic value, we will pursue strategic buys, right, and look for lower-cost modes of transport. And what we saw is that inventory turns declined, but not necessarily in line with all our business volumes, and that was really largely a result, Shannon, of the strategic buys that we did in the quarter. So we want to remain open to evaluate those economic opportunities, both for strategic buys and frankly, for lower-cost modes of transport throughout the year. At the same time, as you just alluded to, your inventory is still at relatively elevated levels and 1Q free cash flow was negative with a tailwind from factoring. And then I have a follow-up. So in terms of how we look at cash for the year, I'd say, first out, our free cash flow for Q1 was absolutely in line with what we expected. And plus, if you look at the earnings outlook that I gave in the guide for the rest of the year. So really, it is the combination of both that give me confidence in our guide of 3% to 3.5% for the year. With that said, we do expect cash flow in Q2, therefore, to be roughly in line with Q1. And just remember, in the second half of the year, PS revenue will grow on the topline. And as you know, that PS contributes cash when it grows sequentially because of its negative cash conversion cycle. I know Shannon brought up that point a moment ago, another sort is obviously continued inventory reductions. And actually this quarter, we did reduce inventory. So both of those, I think, are just really good examples of how we think about cash flow for the year. So as we've guided, we do expect print margins to be above the high end of the range going forward, at least for 2023. And really, it's a tale of what you saw in Q1. The Print margins are really driven by, I think, our strategy working. And you see that, I think, in a couple of dimensions, both in terms of rebalancing the profitability between hardware supplies, also just shifting the business into HP+, Big Tanks. In fact, if you look at the last quarter, more than 50%, 56% of the units shipped were in that HP+ and Big Tank. I think if you look at what we did in this last quarter, it's a really good example of where you're seeing the actions both around Future Ready cost cutting, expense management are all showing up, combined with resilient pricing. So what we saw in Q1, Erik, is really what we expect to see for the rest of the year in Print. So during this quarter, we have made some changes in the definition of the growth categories because we wanted to align better how we talk about them externally to some of the internal changes we have made. By growth categories, we really are referring to the six businesses that we think are going to be growing faster than the core business and that we're going to have accretive margins compared to core. Something common, they have a common strategic intent, which is really to create more value for our customers by focusing on the long-term relationship with those customers. And this is behind the expansion into services, subscriptions and many of these businesses. During the last quarter, we made two internal changes, one is we created a focused organization to work, go after workforce solutions and services. As we went through all these changes, we realign also how we externally will be reporting those especially in the Workforce Solutions & Services, since we are really focused now on service-enabled businesses. I will just highlighting the changes because, for example, as we have done that, the overall size of Workforce Solutions is going to be smaller than what it was because we have redesigned, redefined the business. Every quarter, we will provide visibility as we have done over the last quarter of the growth of the different businesses, you see that on the deck. And they did grow double-digit collectively in the quarter as well Ananda, just to answer part of your question. And then my quick follow-up is, Enrique, you mentioned in the prepared remarks and you just mentioned a moment ago, shifting the HP portfolio towards subscription. So this is something that we shared already in our Investor Day a couple of years ago, so it's not new. But we see an opportunity to better serve our customers by expanding our subscription business from supplies to eventually other parts of the portfolio, our long-term direction is to enable a large part of the HP portfolio, but this is a journey that is going to take multiple quarters. When I think about your comments about how the TAM develops in fiscal 2023, if I extrapolate what you've done in the past pre-COVID it would suggest that by, let's say, by fiscal Q4, your PC segment could be basically flat on a year-over-year basis. And then I have a follow-up. So obviously, a big part of this is, I think what Enrique said earlier around the channel inventory. We do expect that, that channel inventory will get cleaned up through the course of Q2 and then into Q3. So at this point, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, we're not expecting any type of macro recovery. But if you sort of group all this together, what we're expecting is we're going to see better PS revenue in the back half as that channel sort of corrects and cleans up. If I think about the profitability of PC for the full-year, and I kind of extrapolate your comments on revenue in the back half. That would suggest that in the second half of the year, just round numbers, quarterly profitability per quarter is going to have to be north of $0.90 per share. So that ties very much to the comments I made earlier around the channel but also just combined with the fact that we do expect, I think I said in my prepared remarks, to see ourselves in the lower half of the range in Q2 as we go through that channel correction. Then as we get into the back half, we're going to see the margin rates lift back up to be fully in the range. And then I would add another factor which did help and contribute actually to the margin in Q1, and that was the mix inside the PS business. So remember, we have now a full quarter of Poly in our numbers and that overall mix shift is also a driver and contributing to the overall margin structure as well. As you were saying from a unit perspective, we expect the TAM of the year to be flattish compared to what it was in 2019, but we expect it to be higher from a revenue perspective because of the change of mix that Marie was explaining. So from a revenue perspective, this has an impact on total TAM, and it will also have an impact on our performance. Perhaps you can just give us an update on how much progress and savings were realized in Q1 and specifically, it looks like SG&A went up considerably sequentially, even though revenues were down. So maybe I will just hit up quickly SG&A, what drove that increase sequentially. And then with respect to the transformation savings, I would say that we're off to a very strong start. And in fact, these savings contributed to the overall results in the quarter. And I would say, look, we are absolutely confident we're on track for the plan for the year. So at this point in time, I'd say we're absolutely committed to delivering at least that $560 million of gross structural run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year. Toni, we have work going across all the areas that we described last quarter from portfolio simplification, removing some elements of the portfolio, simplifying them making our processes more efficient using some digital tools, looking for efficiencies across the board. So I think we have a full program across the company driving that, and we are making very good progress. And just to reiterate, Toni, they're in both cost of sales and OpEx. So if I think just really high level, midpoint of your guidance sort of points to about $3.3 billion in net income. You have $400 million in restructuring costs that would take you down to $2.9 million, adjusting just for that. So if I just look at those three structural things, you're actually looking below $3 billion. So perhaps starting with my bridge, you can tell me what's missing and how we can get comfortable with $3 billion to $3.5 billion? So I think just to reiterate what I did say earlier that both the Q1 numbers and the earnings guide that we gave last quarter, we're absolutely committed to those yet again. But to build off your bridge, so one additional point that you pointed out just around working capital. So obviously, we'll be managing those, pending any economic opportunities for strategic buys, as I said earlier. The other important point to think about is the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we talked about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a bit about this during the call, it's just that second half improvement that we're expecting in Personal Systems revenue. As you know, PS contributes cash when it grows sequentially, and that's because it has that negative cash conversion cycle. And do you think the overall business for Print has reached a bottom in Q1, considering supplies are starting to improve and commercial constraints are starting to ease as well. We did actually see supplies performed better in Q1 and our guidance that, I think the guidance we gave in our prepared remarks is that we expect it to decline by only high single digits in Q2. As we sort of think about the year, we do expect supplies revenue growth to be back to what we said at our Analyst Day, so back in that sort of low to mid-single digit. Some of the sort of drivers of that, firstly, are really the strength that we're seeing around consumer usage and share trends. Plus I think I commented earlier, just around the pricing resiliency that we're seeing in print and specifically in supplies. And then finally, I'll just add because I know many of you asked this question, is just around the channel inventory. And if you look across our entire sort of multi-tiered ecosystem, supplies channel inventory is in very good shape. And I will say now it also when we are above, looking at quarter-on-quarter comparison one year, is really not the best way to look at the health of the business. This is why Marie was saying, we continue to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we maintain the guide that we had for the year for supplies. Small changes one quarter could have a big impact on the quarter-on-quarter compared, so is really not the right way to look at the health of the business. A quick follow-up here is that if I look at the full-year EPS guide being unchanged, obviously, but there is a lot of different moving parts. Partly, on the goods on the positive side, you've got foreign exchange being better, margins seems to be better. It sounds like on the negative side, there's some PC demand weaker than you expected. Look, maybe I'll start out and say, look, the outlook, as you know, we've got a pretty broad range there. And as always, I think you see that from us. First and foremost, we've talked a bit about our cost actions today for Future Ready. And as I said earlier with Toni, we're working that funnel to pull even more savings into FY2023. Plus, we did get a chance to hit on today, just the continued improvement in supply chain. And then finally, just remember, at the midpoint, we don't expect a macro, but we're working multiple scenarios. Second, from a revenue perspective, as I said before, the way PCs are used today, the applications that are being used for drive better mix require better configurations. Additional to that, we see the adjacencies around PCs like the hybrid opportunity in video conferencing systems, cameras that are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we believe the hybrid work is here to stay. And the shift to services, whether it's contractual services for businesses or subscriptions for consumers also gives us an opportunity of growing the business and growing the TAM. But since you are a customer already of Instant Ink, let me do a small commercial, you should enroll now to the paper program because now you can get not only ink, but you can get only paper, which is an addition to the program. And over time, you will be able to buy the next printer and other type of services from us. Because now Poly is integrated, it's a full-year into your books. But I would say one point, which I think you hit on there, which is that we are very focused on keeping our gross leverage under two. So consistent with maintaining our leverage ratio, we don't anticipate buying back shares in Q2, but we do expect that we'll have room for share repurchases in the back half of the year. So I'd just like to kind of close and say, look, we're committed to staying within our target leverage range. For us, maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating is just critical to our business, Jim. I would like to add like as our leverage ratio will allow us, we continue to believe that buying back shares is a great way to return value to our shareholders, and this is something that we plan to continue to do as we have done in the last years. And I think with that, this was the last question. First of all, that even in a challenging environment, we have delivered on the commitments that we made a quarter ago based on the progress we have made in the areas that we can control whether it's costs, price, price mix, growing share in profitable categories. And at the same time, we have maintained investment in the growth areas because we think that our goal continues to be to position HP in a strong way for whenever the economic recovery will happen."
