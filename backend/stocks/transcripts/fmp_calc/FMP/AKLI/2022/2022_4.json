    "content": " In addition to seeing the initial impact of our direct sales force on demand for EndeavorRx, during Q4, we also saw refill prescriptions growth more than 200% over the third quarter of 2022. During the fourth quarter, we saw about 1,800 prescriptions written for EndeavorRx, a 37% increase over Q3 2022 and a 176% increase over Q4 2021. There were 1,064 new prescriptions written during the period, similar to the number written in Q3 2022 despite 8 fewer selling days during the period, representing a more than 100% increase in Q4 2022 over Q4 2021. As you see on the slide, in the fourth quarter of 2022, EndeavorRx revenues grew to $111,000, representing a 35% growth over third quarter of 2022 and a 76% growth over the fourth quarter of 2021. The growth of expenses compared to the third quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by expenses related to the commercial launch support of EndeavorRx, the ADHD label expansion studies and also the costs associated with the business combination and operating as a public company."
