    "content": " Of the thousands of EndeavorRx prescriptions written to date, the vast majority of families have paid out of pocket, and we're committed to driving change to improve access and to reduce the current socioeconomic disparity we see in treating mental health disorders, including ADHD. From a caregiver perspective, new prescription conversion from written to dispensed in the third quarter continued to be greater than 50% as it was in the second quarter of 2022, which we view as an indication that parents see value in EndeavorRx and are willing to pay out of pocket for the treatment."
