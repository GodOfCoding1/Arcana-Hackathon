    "content": " The approximate 380 basis point decline was primarily due to the following factors; a decline in product margin of approximately 225 basis points due to promotional activity, primarily in apparel and a higher mix of e-commerce sales, which carry a lower margin than brick and mortar sales; increased cost of freight transportation of approximately 90 basis points, this is driven by higher fuel costs and an increase in our e-commerce mix; deleverage of store occupancy costs of approximately 90 basis points, mainly due to the year over year decline in total sales, coupled with higher rent and utility costs. As a result of product margin headwinds, higher freight and transportation costs, store occupancy deleverage and a higher mix of e-commerce sales, gross margin as a percent of net sales is anticipated to decline by approximately 290 to 310 basis points compared to fiscal 2022 results."
