    "content": " However, and looking back three years to fiscal 2020, the last relevant comparable period prior to the pandemic, current quarter sales of $392.8 million were 55.6% higher than the $252.4 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Brick-and-mortar comp sales decreased 11.9% versus the same period in the prior year, although they have increased by 22% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Store operating, selling, and administrative expenses were 23.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '23, compared to 22.3% net sales for the second quarter of last year. We generated $32.8 million of operating income or 8.4% of net sales in the second quarter, compared to $61.5 million or 14.7% of net sales in the prior year's second quarter. E-commerce represented approximately 15.2% of total sales for the quarter versus last year's 13.1%, continued improvements to our customer experience with gains in total customers increased traffic for our website ads by over 20% year-over-year. The global gross margin is still above pre-pandemic levels, potential supply chain challenges, rate headwinds, higher e-commerce sales attributable to lower margin and Brick-and-mortar sales, inflationary pressures and de-leveraging store occupancy will all contribute to this anticipated decline, we continue to believe gross margin results compared to the fiscal '22 will become more favorable as the years pass.
