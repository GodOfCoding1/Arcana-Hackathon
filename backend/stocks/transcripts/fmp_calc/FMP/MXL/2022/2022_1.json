    "content": " Our comments today include forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements relating to our guidance for second quarter 2022 revenue, revenue growth expectations and our principal target markets, and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, effective tax rate and interest and other expense. In addition, we will make forward-looking statements relating to trends, opportunities and uncertainties in various product and geographic markets, including, without limitation, statements concerning opportunities arising from our broadband, wireless, infrastructure and connectivity markets and opportunities for improved revenues across our target markets. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including risks arising from competition, supply constraints facing the semiconductor industry, global trade and export restrictions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our dependence on the limited number of customers, average selling price trends and risks that our target markets and growth opportunities may not develop as we currently expect and then our assumptions concerning these opportunities may prove incorrect. I think as we look out into '23, I mean, there's a good shot of seeing that kind of double again, next year in 2023, because it's still pretty early days on the fiber side."
