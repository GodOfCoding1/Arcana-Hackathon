    "content": " Furthermore, in the second quarter, largely due to non-member to member conversion, the number of our entry-level or 688 member MAUs, which includes a large group of direct shippers, increased by over 40% year-over-year and exceeded that of our second-tier, or 1688 member MAUs, for the first time. Our total revenues in the second quarter were RMB1.7 billion, representing an increase of 49.3% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from freight matching services. Revenues from freight matching services, including service fees from freight brokerage models, membership fees from listing models, and commissions from online transaction services were RMB1.4 billion in the second quarter, representing an increase of 50.3% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our freight brokerage service as well as rapid growth in transaction commissions. Revenues from freight brokerage service in the second quarter were RMB850.2 million, representing an increase of 41.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by significant growth in transaction volume as a result of improved user penetration. Revenues from freight listing service in the second quarter were RMB211.7 million, up 20.7% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in total paying members. Revenues from transaction commissions amounted to RMB347.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 116.2% year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued ramp-up of commissioned GTV penetration, and partially offset by a decrease in GTV due to COVID outbreaks. Revenues from value-added services in the second quarter were RMB260.4 million, an increase of 43.7% year-over-year, primarily attributable to increased revenues from credit solutions."
