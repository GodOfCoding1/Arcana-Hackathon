    "content": " And then within Framing, our window and wall business unit, where we saw an opportunity and still do to see some significant improvement in margins, they have purposely stopped quoting in a number of different project types and product offerings that we just looked at and said, even if we are best in margin, it doesn't get us to where we want to be from a profitability standpoint. And then as we look forward, just what we've talked about, we have seen strong demand, strong bid activity and so as that is building in our backlog, too early to guide on that, I would say that we're seeing as we build that backlog, margin improvement from where we are today, and we expect that as that flows in our fiscal '24 and '25 that, that will provide some tailwinds, particularly as we get into '25 and '26 as that project work starts to fully execute as well. And that's why as we looked at our guidance and looking at how we performed in the second half, while they're working through that, they're going to be focused on working to maintain margins in that long-term goal of 9% to 12%, and I think they're on track. And as Mark alluded to, that mix shift, we're seeing that showing up in the bid and award activity and I think that's a tailwind for that business as we go into fiscal '24 because a lot of that isn't going to flow through the plant and revenue rec until the very end of this year, and it's more of a '24-story that give additional tailwinds for that business. But more importantly, as we alluded to earlier in the call and through this Q&A, we see really strong momentum in driving our long-term strategy of really building a strong business, being the economic leader in driving those margin improvements and setting ourselves up to outperform the market regardless of that outlook, both from a revenue and an income basis as we go forward."
