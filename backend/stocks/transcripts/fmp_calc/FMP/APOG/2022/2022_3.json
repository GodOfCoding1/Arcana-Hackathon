    "content": " Through 3 quarters, Framing's adjusted margins have improved by 40 basis points compared to last year. As a reminder, last year's third quarter included a $7.4 million upside related to a new market tax credit in the Glass segment. Also, the temporary cost actions we took in response to COVID added another $7 million of operating income in last year's third quarter. Between the new market tax credit, reversal of temporary cost actions and inflation, we faced over $23 million of year-over-year headwinds in this quarter. As mentioned earlier, last year's quarter included $7.4 million of operating income related to new market tax credit. Turning to Large-Scale Optical, revenue of $27 million grew 8% compared to last year's third quarter. Margins were lower than last year's third quarter driven by onetime costs from expedited freight, which offset the benefit from improved sales mix. We actually, as I commented, we saw a very strong last month of the quarter from Glass as some of those productivity improvements started to take hold, and we expect we'll see that build in the fourth quarter and then as we go into the first quarter of next year from a margin perspective on Glass."
