    "content": " The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by input cost inflation, which was a $20 million headwind in the quarter and higher labor costs, mainly resulting from the reversal of temporary cost actions we had in place last year. Also as a reminder, last year\u2019s third quarter included $7.4 million benefit in architectural glass related to new market tax credit. Your line is open. I will tell you that through the strategy work, we identified significant opportunities to improve our margin and that\u2019s really the focus and emphasis for that business right now and probably well into fiscal \u201823 that we want to refocus in parts of the market where we can differentiate ourselves more strongly, delivering more value to the customers, which in turn shows up as more value for Apogee and our shareholders with respect to margins. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I may have missed it, when you announced the restructuring a couple of months ago, I think you said $30 million to $35 million in costs and now it\u2019s, what, $25 million \u2013 $20 million to $25 million or something like that."
