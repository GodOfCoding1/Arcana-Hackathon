    "content": " Turning to large scale optical, revenue of $27 million grew 23% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Your line is open. This is the first quarter where they have been able to offset all of the inflationary impact across our businesses, so that trend is--that new muscle that we have built on offsetting inflation is going to continue throughout fiscal \u201923. Your line is open. What we saw as we closed out the quarter in terms of both pricing and cost, we saw improvements there, so we do expect that momentum to carry forward here in fiscal \u201923, staying ahead on the price and inflationary side, and then also taking advantage of the cost structure efforts that they did last year, and frankly there\u2019s some upside there because we\u2019re really just reinvigorating the lean efforts in framing. We\u2019re trying to balance what we need to do on price but also taking costs out where we can to offset some of that and stay competitive, so a lot of the challenges we saw last year, I think carry through most of this calendar year, which is the bulk of our fiscal \u201923, so pricing on raw materials and just general supply of raw materials. Your line is open. As we look at fiscal \u201923, I think we\u2019ll still see--we\u2019re going to see revenue growth and we\u2019ll still see that primarily led by price, but some of the indicators are that we will see positive volume starting to come through on that business as well. Your line is open. Your line is open."
