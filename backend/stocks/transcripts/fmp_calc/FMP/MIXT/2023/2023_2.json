    "content": " Financially, we generated $35.3 million of total revenue and delivered 17% year-over-year growth in ARR on a constant currency basis, ending the quarter with $128.4 million of ARR. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress in our U.S. expansion initiatives through the acquisition of Trimble\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Field Service Management business or FSM, which added an additional 38,000 subscribers and $10.6 million in ARR to our group. Subscription revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $30.7 million or 87% of total revenue, compared to $30.9 million or 86% of total revenue in the same period a year ago. While we reported strong constant currency top line performance, our reported dollar revenues were impacted by the dollar's recent strength against all major currencies, the impact of translating foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, led to a 10.7% decrease in reported U.S. dollar subscription revenues, compared to a year ago. Annual recurring revenue or ARR was $128.4 million on a constant currency basis ARR increased 12.9% in the second quarter sequentially, of which 9.4% is attributable to the FSM business. In terms of our expectations for the current fiscal year and accounting for the acquisition of the FSM business, we expect our total constant currency subscription revenue growth to move into double-digits and would like to reiterate that organic growth is expected to remain in the mid to high single-digits."
