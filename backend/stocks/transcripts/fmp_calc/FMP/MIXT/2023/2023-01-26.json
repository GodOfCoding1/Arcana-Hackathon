    "content": "   Operator: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss MiX Telematics' Financial Results for the Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 ended December 31, 2022. Financially, we generated $37.8 million of total revenue and delivered 17% year-over-year growth in ARR on a constant currency basis, ending the quarter with $131.8 million of annual recurring revenue. As a percentage of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA increased to 22.2% compared to 19.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 17% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. With expanding adjusted EBITDA margins and the easing of the global supply chain pressures, we are well positioned to generate significant free cash flow, both in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the full fiscal 2024 year. Regarding our expectations for the current fiscal year and considering the acquisition of the FSM business last quarter, we continue to anticipate that we'll report double-digit constant currency subscription revenue growth for the fiscal 2023 year."
