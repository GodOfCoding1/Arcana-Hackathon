    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million, at a 19.6% margin, which was modestly below our expectations for the quarter, due to a very large unbundled win where the customer is paying for the hardware upfront. ARR, which we believe will be a more meaningful indicator of our growth this fiscal year was $119 million at the end of the third quarter, growing 1.3% sequentially on a constant currency basis. Hardware and other revenue of $5.9 million were up 17% year-over-year, representing 16.3% of total revenue, the highest quarterly performance for hardware in the previous four years. We expect hardware revenue and our blended gross margin to remain at the current level for the next few quarters as we've worked through the backlog of some of the larger wins we mentioned, which include our new Vision AI devices. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter were $4 million or 11.1% of revenue compared to 8.5% in the year ago period, representing the continuing investments in our sales and marketing growth initiatives."
