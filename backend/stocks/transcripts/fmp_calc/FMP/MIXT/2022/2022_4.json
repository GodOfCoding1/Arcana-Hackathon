    "content": " For the fourth quarter subscription revenue of $31.3 million was up 7% in constant currency, excluding the one-time renewal fee related to a large contract modification in Q4 of last year. South African Rand weakened against the U.S. dollar compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, contributing to a 0.9% decrease in a reported subscription revenues. As a reminder, the prior year fourth quarter comparison included a one-time non-recurring fee of approximately $1.1 million related to a contract renewal that was included in subscription revenue. While we are pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter, we do expect some volatility in fiscal year 2023, as we work through some of the supply chain challenges that impact costs and the higher mix of hardware revenue due to some of the large unbundled wins in our backlog."
