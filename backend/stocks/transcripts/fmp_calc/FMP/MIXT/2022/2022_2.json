    "content": " Looking beyond fiscal 2022, we see a number of encouraging market trends that we believe will support our ability to drive steady improvement towards our long-term financial targets of 15% to 20% constant currency subscription revenue growth and 30% adjusted EBITDA margins. Notably, our annual recurring revenue or ARR ended the quarter at $128 million, up 2.5% sequentially, and a 5% improvement year-to-date in constant currency. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to track well against that full year financial objective of mid to high single-digit constant currency subscription revenue growth, low double-digit annual recurring revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid 20s. The South African rand strengthened against the US dollar compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, contributing to a 9% increase in our reported revenues. ARR, which we believe will be a more meaningful indicator of our growth this fiscal year was $128 million at the end of the second quarter, growing 2.5% sequentially on a constant currency basis."
