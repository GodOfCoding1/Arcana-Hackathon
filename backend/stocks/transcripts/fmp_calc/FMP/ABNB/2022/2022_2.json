    "content": " And we're just seeing strong overall nights kind of growth, the 25% year-over-year growth in nights and experiences, we feel very confident in. And as I said, the Q2 nights and experiences grew 25% year-over-year, we're seeing a similar growth for Q3, and our demand in Q4 reservations is really strong, as I mentioned kind of earlier. And there's just so much pent-up demand for travel and just so much demand for travel in general, that people would like to spend money on the experience of travel and getting out of their home more than on things that we're just continuing to see that great strength in our business. And what we're just finding is that people can come to Airbnb because we have any kind of property, whether it's a small shared room or a private room to luxury stays, we have something for anyone depending on their travel needs. And as we manage -- look at the cohorts, really, what we're seeing in 2020 and 2021, the new guest cohorts, they've been actually very retentive, even maybe more so than kind of historical levels likely due to some self-selection. And then in terms of rebooking rates of past guests, we've seen nice improving rates in those trends here in 2022, above kind of 2021 levels, but maybe still a bit below 2019, again, just given the nature of self-selection of who's willing to kind of travel at this time. Well, if anything, what we're seeing is an acceleration of the business here in July and actually kind of a very stable overall nights booked growth for the quarter on Nights and Experiences Booked. And then to our overall business, we're just seeing that as we generate nights stayed in euro and pounds and then we bring them back to the U.S. and into the U.S. dollar, we're just seeing the headwind of foreign exchange, which was -- which is material in Q1, it was 600 basis points of revenue growth driven by the FX move."
