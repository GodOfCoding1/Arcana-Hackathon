    "content": " As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations section of Airbnb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website following this call. On the call today, we have Airbnb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Co-Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Stephenson. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our third quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Well, thank you, Ellie and good afternoon, everyone. We had nearly 100 million Nights and Experiences Booked, which is up 25% year-over-year. Revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, our highest ever. And when you exclude foreign exchange, our revenue increased 36% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, also our highest ever and we generated $960 million of free cash flow. In fact, over the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. And even with the macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe that we are well positioned for the road ahead. Well, new use cases such as long-term stays and non-urban travel are here to stay. At the same time, we have seen recovery in urban and cross-border travel, two of our strongest segments before the pandemic. And just like during the Great Recession in 2008, when everything started, people today are especially interested in earning extra income through hosting. Now during the quarter, we saw a number of positive business trends. First, guest demand on Airbnb remains strong. Now even with macroeconomic headwinds, Nights and Experiences Booked increased 25%. And during the quarter, we also continued to see longer lead times, supporting a stronger backlog for Q4. And now even as these two segments return, demand for domestic and non-urban travel remains strong. Third, guests continue to stay longer on Airbnb. Over the last year, we have seen many companies require their employees to return to the office. And at the same time, long-term stay remains 20% of our total gross nights booked on Airbnb. For instance, in Q3, as guests were returning to cities, we saw urban supply accelerate. Second, since Airbnb began in 2008, posts have consistently churned Airbnb to earn extra income. In fact, since 2008, hosts on Airbnb have earned $180 billion in our platform. Third, over last year, we made several product improvements to help onboard and support our hosts, but we are not stopping there. On November 16, we are going to introduce an all-new super easy way for millions of people to turn to Airbnb their homes as part of our winter release. Now with these upgrades and more, we aim to unlock the next generation of hosts and improve the experience for more than 4 million people that are already hosting. So just to recap, we had a record Q3, Nights and Experiences Booked were our highest Q3 ever, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were record high, free cash flow was $950 million. And in the last 12 months, we have generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow. So with that, Dave and I look forward to answer your questions. Dave, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I answer these and then you can go at a high level and you can go specifically into the booking side question. But Lloyd, what I am going to do is I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll answer it at a little more of a high level. So one of the things that we have seen is, despite a lot of consumers pulling back on spending, the one area that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen them pullback on as much is travel. And in particular, like travel, where you can go and see your friends, see your family, more inspirational type of travel, in other words, meaningful travel and not just mass travel. And I think the reason why is just because many people are now working from home, the mall is now Amazon. The movie theater is now Netflix, people still want to get out of their house. And so just like people continue to travel this quarter, we expect really strong demand for Airbnb next year. At the same time, our urban and cross-border businesses are incredibly strong because of the value that we provide. On the supply side, I just would remind everyone that we started Airbnb in 2008 during the Great Recession. And at that time, many people were turning to Airbnb to earn extra income. And so we think this will be also a great time for millions of people to consider hosting, which is why we are focused on this on November 16. With regards to Experiences, to answer your question very simply, the great thing about Experiences is we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to have very much incremental investment to make this work. Dave, feel free to take \u00e2\u0080\u0093 anything else you want to add. And as we stated, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually 36% growth year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. 4 weeks in this quarter, we are seeing really strong promising trends in cross-border, renewed interest in urban stays, stabilizing cancellations and just strong future bookings. On our guidance for Q4, we are anticipating revenue growth between 17% and 23%. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 23% to 29%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And maybe I will just take a minute to double click here, because one of the things we are seeing is the difference in the behavior that we had last year. If you actually go back to 2019 at historic rates, we are actually seeing stable to increasing demand for bookings here from Q3 into Q4. The decel that we see from Q3 into Q4 is really a hard comp on Q4 last year, where we had really strong demand after Delta and before Omicron. And if you go back and compare back to 2019, we are seeing stable to increasing demand across the globe. And have actually aimed areas to highlight and you see it in our letter, is that APAC had some of the stronger growth, 65% growth in APAC. And excluding China, APAC is now kind of above 2019 level. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been kind of the last major region to kind of return to 2019. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Dave \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you take these, I can round out the answers. In terms of European demand, we are seeing strong European demand from places like the U.S., where the dollar is stronger than the euro. And conversely, the European travel is going to be maybe less likely to come say to the U.S. where the U.S. dollar is so strong. Overall, the impact of foreign exchange isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as large on the business because of the regional impacts. And then in terms of advertising ROI, we are really pleased with our approach to the marketing strategy that we have had. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, I guess when we look at kind of U.S. to international travel, is the strength in U.S. dollar maybe helping drive more interest in going overseas? And then the second question on durability of kind of ADRs, as elevated home prices may be making host less likely to lower the rate at which they are willing to take kind of from here. Dave, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take the first question, I can take the second. Again, as I just said, on the U.S. international, we clearly do have a strong U.S. dollar, which enables Americans to travel abroad quite well and we are seeing nice strength there. And again, that part of the business is not so large as to have a material impact on the overall business, because you also have some of the offsets of weaker currencies, not necessarily travel in the U.S. Again, more of the travel is domestic and intra-regional, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to kind of drive things and more of the foreign exchange issues are not as pronounced within the given region. And I think just regarding elevated home prices and what that does to average daily rate on Airbnb, I mean just to zoom out, people come to Airbnb because they can find a great value. And that means that we need to give tools for host, more tools for them to be able to better price their listings. So, one of the things we are doing is we are going to continue to move towards a more all-in pricing, where when you see pricing, instead of seeing more of a nightly rate, you are going to see a little bit more of a fully loaded rate. And then our search ranking is going to prioritize great value, great deal for the fully loaded price. And if we do all these things, I believe we will be even more competitive from a pricing standpoint than we are today. Just to zoom out, we have a global network where demand drives supply. And just to give you an example, this past quarter, approximately 35% of our new available hosts had started as guests. So this is a really strong network where guests become host and the host as they get more bookings, they tend to tell their friends about it, and then we get more supply that way. And so this is, I think, one of the things that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really, really important. But beyond that, obviously, we want to be very aggressive about recruiting more hosts to Airbnb, because this is a great time. And because of the softening economy, we think increasingly now more than ever before, people are interested in putting their homes on Airbnb to make supplemental income. I would highlight too, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked to people that are considering hosting, they have told us two things. On November 16, as part of our winter release, number one, we are going to unveil an all new super easy way for millions of people to put their home on Airbnb. Second, to make people feel comfortable about having other people in their home, which will unlock a lot more everyday people putting their real homes on Airbnb, we are going to be providing some huge upgrades and improvements to AirCover for host. If we do these two things, I think we are going to help unlock significantly greater amounts of supply, which is already on top of the momentum that we have and we have seen in Q3. Maybe the final thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just say is in addition to adding more supply in Airbnb, the Holy Grail is pointing demand to where we have supply, because I know night globally on Airbnb, are we ever close to 100% occupied. And this is the whole theory around Airbnb categories that instead of hoping people type in the place you have available supply in the search box, you can then come and have more of a browse experience where we highlight homes that are available. As far as pain points, as far as like from a regulatory standpoint, I mean, one of the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen is a redistribution away from very large city kind of to everywhere. And a lot of cities and a lot of local communities have been actually reaching out to us, because they can see the economic opportunity we provide. So we are working really, really closely with these markets, but we are feeling very optimistic about our supply for 2023. Let me just double click it too on a couple of Brian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s points, because I think they are really important because of these partnerships that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with local governments, especially on tax collection, we have delivered more than $6 billion in tourism-related taxes to local governments. And I think in terms of like zoning regulations, we believe that the reasonable regulation actually normalizes hosting. And when you normalize hosting, it can really be a foundation for future growth. So we actually think that you do this in a reasonable way, and it will actually be a tailwind to growth in the future. Thanks for taking my question. The first one, just to maybe try to cut the business a little bit different way. And then the second one, Brian, you made so many improvements to the platform over the years from unflexible and trying to load balance supply and demand, etcetera. Yes, in terms of the active bookers, I think you kind of step back and look at the marketing approach that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had since pre COVID and that we really has accelerated in COVID in sense has been to continue to focus on the overall brand of Airbnb and to be less reliant on search engine marketing. And in terms of the cohorts of new, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually seeing that the cohorts that are coming in since COVID are actually as strong, if not even stronger than they were in prior to COVID. The people that are willing to kind of travel right now and experience Airbnb have are really sticky, and the cohorts are as strong and not stronger than we saw previously. Sorry, sorry, I just want to answer about conversion of traffic for unflexible. But I would actually generally say, Brian, that we actually think about it even more broadly. When we launch Airbnb Categories, for example, one of the goals was not just increased conversion, but was actually to increase traffic. And there is a scenario where you can increase traffic, initially conversion can go down because you are a little bit more in the inspiration business. So we are really excited about the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making between Airbnb Categories, which is really bringing a lot more traffic to Airbnb, plenty demand were half supply, bringing us top of funnel. There would be AirCover for guests, which is making people feel more assured about their experience and allowing a more consistent form of reliability. And this, of course, will continue to lead to greater conversion. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Brian, I know you talked about strong growth in new hosts and a lot of them seeing new income opportunities. And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the early returns on the spring update categories. But at the highest level, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually pretty simple. In \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as the economy slows down, I think people are looking for more ways to make either supplemental income or like greater yield on the assets they have. And so whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second homes or primary homes, I think there is going to be a pretty big opportunity for us. As far as some of the metrics we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, again, as I said, conversion has steadily picked up. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing us continue to spread out bookings to more and more markets, which is a bit of the Holy Grail to be on the point demand we have supply. With AirCover for guests, which is another very important upgrade that we made because this is AirCover for guests really addresses a bit of the chilly fuel of Airbnb, which is on the one hand, we have this incredible one-of-a-kind homes. Other hand, one of a kind can be variable in consistency. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched AirCover for guests, NPS is up and probably even more importantly, rebooking rates when I guess it dissatisfied is also up. And so if we can do these two things: on the front end, continue to be more in the inspiration business, point demand already have supply. On the back end, make sure that Airbnb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are meeting your expectations. And in the rare event that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, we make it right, then these are going to continue to unlock significantly greater growth for us in the year ahead. They are the people that own a first \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a primary home or maybe a secondary home and a big strength of our business, we saw this in COVID is that people even during an economic kind of shock period, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get rid of their primary home. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get necessarily getting rid of their secondary home, which is very different than professional hosts that maybe are doing an arbitrage of exact cost of ownership and return on the investment they can get on that specific property versus other alternatives. And so I think that this helps buffer any of those kind of impacts on our businesses, that individual host community. And then much bigger picture, solid bookings for 31% growth. Alright, Dave, I think you can take this one. In terms of the backlog for \u00e2\u0080\u009823, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little early to tell, but really, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is continued strong demand for travel overall. And like I said, when you look back to historic levels of growth back to 2019, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing stable to increasing demand. We have strong bookings on the books for Q4, but then there will be fewer on the books yet for it kind of tails off into 2023. Thanks for taking the questions. Post, you can then choose to add a cleaning fee and then Airbnb ad service fees. And one of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hearing from guests, and we heard it loud and clear, is that people would like a little more transparency about what they are actually paying when they first get to Airbnb. And so we are working on redesigning how pricing works on Airbnb, so people better understand the total price they are going to pay the moment they arrive at Airbnb, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a surprise for them. And sometimes to tell us that they are not aware of what guests are paying because as you know, we add a guest service fee on top of the price that the host charge and occasionally hosts that they are charging more than they intended to. And so we are updating some of the tools to make it easier for hosts to understand what they are charging, and this will allow them to be more competitive. In addition to that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be updating our search ranking algorithm. One of the questions we ask is on a scale of 1 to 5, how good of a value was this, and home to offer a great value are going to be prioritized higher in search results. And in addition to that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to develop new discounting tools, discounting tools like seasonal discounts, weekly discounts, peak season discounts and really tools to make host more competitive. If we do all this, I do believe the prices will get even more competitive. And one of the things we know is obviously as the prices get more competitive, conversion rate goes up and as conversion rate goes up, bookings go up. Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question, Mario. I mean this is a company that, obviously, in the last quarter did more than $1 billion in net income, nearly $1 billion of free cash flow. So I think there is a lot of levers to increase monetization on Airbnb, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we have to increase take rate to do that. In other words, there is opportunities like to allow additional services to host that we could charge for, and we think they pay for that we can do. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re booking a place for 2, 3, 4 months, we think conversion rate might go up if we were to lower the take rate a little bit. So we are going to continue to look at some optimization, but we think that we provide a great value. And I think if we make some of these pricing and discount changes in the coming future, I think the value on Airbnb will get even better. But our general view is if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to charge more, we should provide more. I mean I could answer the high level and Dave, you can go in. I mean, Bernie, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very great question. And the reason why is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just the European business, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just a North American business. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also an urban business, also a cross-border business. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also popular with millennials, Gen Z and retiree at nearly every type of price point. So I think that however travel demand changes, we will be able to adapt. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a global network, guests become hosts. Most hosts are regular people that tell their friends about Airbnb, which is why when a market occupancy increases, it tends in itself create more supply. So these are some of the reasons why we feel very, very excited about our ability to continue to adapt given this challenging macroeconomic environment. I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a great value that we provide, right, that can people can pick anything from budget to luxe. And if a person has a certain kind of budget constraint, they can choose to maybe get a slightly smaller place or place with fewer amenities maybe they are well further out, like they can adjust the type of home they want based on their budget. And I think Airbnb has such a diversity of offerings that, that enables them to do it uniquely with us, which is very different than the flexibility they might have in hotels. And when we spoke with hoteliers in general, I think they are planning to keep the ADRs high and with reduced staffing levels. Yes, James, yes, I think that as we give more tools to host to be able to dynamically price, they can be more competitive. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 other than changing how pricing will be displayed to make it more transparent, intuitive and to continue to offer better value, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not actually looking at a fundamental change to our pricing structure. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, based on commentary, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing urban coming back. And then maybe just the same question regionally, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more skewed to the North American market than you were pre-COVID. In terms of like urban coming back, it just continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our overall mix. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite back to where it was in 2019, and it may never quite be because we see such great strength in our non-urban but urban is strengthening each quarter. And what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just seen is a cross-border continues to be a greater, greater percentage every quarter, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not quite back to where we were in 2019. David, could I ask you just adjust the over-earning question that the free cash flow margins are truly very impressive. But Brian, these features can sometimes take quite a long time to kind of get broadly used and the doubt that they can have a major impact. And I think this is one of those that could, how long do you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take for Categories to be kind of widely adopted used and really start impacting and helping people better match up that supply \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all the supply you have with the demand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there? I think, Dave, you can take the first one, and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take Categories. So yes, the free cash flow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really proud of our delivery of the free cash flow and the free cash flow margin. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being incredibly disciplined in our fixed cost growth, and that will continue going forward. As average daily rates could moderate next year, that does put a little bit of a headwind towards our margins. What we will continue to have greater expansion in free cash flow margin to be some of the things that Brian talked about a little bit ago, it would be kind of incremental services or activities that we add for guests or host over time. And there is no immediate announcements of major changes that you should anticipate in \u00e2\u0080\u009823, but know that, that is a focus for us and over a more extended period will drive incremental revenue for us and incremental margin. And to answer your other question about the kind of timing for wide adoption of Airbnb Categories, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question. I think just to kind of zoom out, customers of travel have been, as you know, trained over the last 25 years to search a certain way. You refine the results, you compare sometimes the different websites, different apps and then you make a booking. Again, we are already seeing people discover home they never knew existed. The homes and categories have been viewed more than 300 million times, we are going to continue to be making improvements to this every single year. And of course, you are going to see some upgrades beyond that as well. So, I think this is a really great opportunity for us. And again, because we are a little more concentrated in vacation travel, the business travel, and because people are increasingly more flexible when they travel, we think they are going to be much more open to ideas from Airbnb. The way the travel funnel used to be, if you go to one website to figure out where to travel, these are typically travel content sites. Then you go to the next site, typically to book your flight, and then the third thing you do is get your hotel or get your housing. So, with Airbnb was kind of step three. This is going to take some retraining for everything to go from step three to step one, but I think there is definitely a line of sight to getting there. So, you guys took off you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you guys took out the China supply, but maintained your outbound business. Stephen, I mean the crown jewel of our China business was always and we thought always was going to be the China outbound business. So, the outbound business was always the price part of our business. Now, as you know, not a lot of people are leaving the country right now, but we want to be prepared for when they do. And so the two things we are doing to prepare is, number one, we are going to be continuing to invest in our brand in China. And number two, if people are traveling and they are leaving China, they are going to other countries, and we would call these the core to countries. And the primary place, they are first probably going to go with intra-region. Eventually, they will go a little further to Europe and then they will presumably come back to the United States, especially maybe the kind of some of the coastal cities. And I think by only having an outbound business, we can actually focus all of our investments just on that, and it actually makes a lot more cost effective, a lot more efficient. And one thing I have learned is more focused we are, the more likely we are to achieve our results. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can on investment strategy. Obviously, we have a lot of technology companies that are talking about slowing hiring, possibly pruning talent out of their organizations. And then the second part of the question is, obviously, a slow in the economy would not be like the existential crisis that travel belt in spring of 2020. Yes, let me just recap how we think about expense management and investments. Before the pandemic, we were essentially a nearly breakeven business doing like a little under $250 million in loss from an EBITDA perspective. And of course, in the pandemic hit, we lost 80% of our business, and we completely changed our cost structure. And the decision we made is we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to wait for another crisis, another weakened economy or a recession to change how we invest or we run the company that we were going to be lean regardless of the economy. In other words, we were going to go from the Navy to the Navy seal, a small, lean, elite group. We are only slightly more than 6,000 people in the beginning of this year. Before obviously, the economy took a turn for the worst, we still only had a plan to hire 7% to 8% more employees. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to change anything about our hiring plans in the next 12 months to 18 months regardless of the economy because one of the lessons we have learned is a smaller we are, the more nimble we are, the faster we can move. So, we are still really aggressive about trying to attract the best of our generation to this company, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean hiring a lot of people. We have one functional organization, and so that allows us to be quite a bit leaner. So, whatever happens to the economy, I think we are in a pretty good position where we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to change the way we run the company. But I think we have proven if we ever have to, of course, we will. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect for us to have to make a lot of changes because of how much cash we are generating, because of how lean we already are. And if I double-click on one area is that we announced our Live and Work Anywhere policy this year, and I think that has enabled us to hire the best people in the world regardless of where they live. And so to Brian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point about hiring fewer, more senior, and more experts in areas, this has clearly been able to make sure that we are getting the best talent in the world. But I think the adversity, the challenge we had just made us a much more focused, a much better company. Because the more disciplined we are, the more focused we are, not only to become more profitable, but we actually innovate faster. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a bigger picture question first, Brian, and then Dave, one for you on just guidance. Just I think, Brian, you were talking maybe intra-quarter about AirCover being a major franchise going forward. We clearly see it for guests, for host. And then, Dave, just on guidance, I think in the letter, we mentioned longer lead time for bookings, stronger backlog for 4Q. I will take obviously the first one, Ron. So yes, questions around kind of the longer-term strategy around AirCover. And maybe the way to explain AirCover, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just take as an analogy, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take Amazon. So, my recollection of Amazon, this will go back maybe 20 years, because 20 years ago, Amazon even back then, their core retail business was an amazing product. And so one of the things they created was Amazon Prime, which was obviously addressing the core Achilles\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heel, which was shipping. But our challenge is unlike a hotel, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control the inventory and it cannot structurally always be as consistent. So, AirCover similar for consistency addresses something similar to what Prime did for Amazon with shipping, which is to say, what if we could take this off the table, this question of consistency. And I think where this can go is over the coming years, we can offer increasingly more protection, more coverage for more different use cases. But let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a home was on two different websites, Airbnb and another website, we want AirCover to be so compelling that just by having AirCover alone, it would be reason to go direct and book on Airbnb and not book anywhere else. And we are going to continue to make improvements every single year, and I want AirCover to be the gold standard for customer service for our category. And then down the road, there may be opportunities to offer like a paid version of this or some other type of membership program, but that would be down the road, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very popular customer request. And then in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to answer the question on guidance, too. On the guidance, articulation of the longer lead times for bookings and just the Q4 bookings that we have already on the books for the rest of this quarter is just to indicate that we have stable to accelerating demand for growth, right. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that we are not seeing a softening in that demand especially when you look back to historic levels of 2019, that any of the deceleration in revenue growth between Q3 and Q4 is largely due to the uniqueness of the 2021 timing of growth between Delta and Omicron. So, I just think it just shows the stability of people wanting to get out their homes, wanting to travel, regardless of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, there has been a lot of press recently about how occupancies on the platform are down for certain house hosts. I mean your 4Q guidance is pretty strong, but just trying to understand how much of this is just kind of noise out there. And then second question, maybe for Brian. Long-term stays is stabilizing near 20% of the mix on the platform, even as sort of your room nights is growing pretty nicely, you have talked about sort of like the flexibility and lifestyle for many people keeping this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or helping this growth. I can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I will take both, and then Dave can feel free to dive in, especially on the bookings. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that might be one possible explanation. But again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primarily what we have seen is anecdotal. But overall, obviously, bookings are up. Now, with regard to long-term stays beyond travel, I mean feedback, I would just say that we have only scratched the surface. And I think in the coming years, flexibility is here to stay. I think increasingly, fewer people are going to have 1-year leases, not to say no one will, but more and more people are going to value the flexibility and want to live in different places. And one of the things we are going to also see over the coming years isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just that people are going to live in different parts of the United States, but people are going to choose to live for short periods of time abroad in different countries. So, we think we are going to start to see more long-term cross-border business, too. I mean the largest expense that most people have in their life is their housing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their housing costs. And as we do, I think we will continue to take more and more of that market. Given that your advertising strategy has moved away from, say, purely demand linked performance advertising and more towards longer-dated ROI investments and brand advertising. I mean if you look at our actual advertising strategy and the amount of money we are spending on it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be relatively flat from \u00e2\u0080\u009822 over \u00e2\u0080\u009821, and you should anticipate similar marketing as a percentage of revenue in \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And what we have actually seen is, to the extent that we are keeping it flat even as we grow, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because we are actually seeing such success that we are wanting to be able to invest in other countries. Certainly, we can moderate that over time, but we are already so low that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate us dropping it dramatically in face of substantial headwinds over growth. I mean we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really think of marketing as a way to buy customers because, obviously, as we have mentioned, more than 90% of our traffic is direct or organic. And actually, we think a bit more like product marketing. So, right now, we are advertising and educating people about Airbnb Categories and AirCover. And this allows for a very efficient, very dynamic approach to marketing that should get more efficient every single year. First, nights came up just a bit light of where we all had it forecasted. And then second, Dave, I know you spoke to this just a minute ago on the backlog, but asked in a different way. Brad, I will take the first question. Yes, I mean what we do see is that many hosts do bring their prices up or down as demand goes up or down. That being said, I think there is opportunities for us to have more dynamic tools and give more visibility that would make prices even more competitive. To answer your question, they do, many hosts do adjust their prices, but I think hosts probably adjust their prices less frequently than hotels. And so in periods of time where prices are generally coming down in the industry, we might be a little bit slower. But as we build more tools to provide more dynamic changes, we will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 continue to be more competitive. I think nights is an important measure, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important driver of kind of overall demand. And on our full guide like you said, I think we are seeing stable to increasing demand, and we are just really impressed with the resiliency of guests and their willingness to travel and interest in traveling Airbnb. And I guess it goes back to the backlog, too, is that the reason why we kind of highlight is just that people are having confidence in travel. So, what we are seeing is that, yes, the booking windows are up year-over-year. So, they are actually booking windows a little bit down from Q3. And so as \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the lead times are just up from historical levels because the people are confident in being able to travel, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the important thing you should take away."
