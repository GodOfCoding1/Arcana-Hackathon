    "content": " So like a lot of people tried to go to New York City on New Year's Eve, and there's only so many places to stay in New York, and so you're going to get sold out. So we're focused on this year is the perishable opportunity of trying to capture as much market share as possible, and get as many people who haven't traveled a couple years to try Airbnb, because for many people, Airbnb is no longer an alternative way to travel. And so we're starting to ramp up that product this year, I think more even more next year, you're going to see some major new offerings around Airbnb experiences and set a few demand. That being said, I think this summer, you're going to start to see a ramp up of experiences, I think next year and beyond it\u2019s going to be a massive opportunity and I\u2019m incredibly excited about it and one of the reasons I am so excited about it is that our guest actually, from a customer satisfaction standpoint, like experience more than homes, they actually leave a significantly higher five star rating as a percentage of their ratings for experiences at home. Yes, I think if you could, again, we have been up 5%, year-over-year in Q1, it is going to be flat relative on year-over-year basis in Q2, you can kind of see a little bit of a decrease of seasonality for Q3, Q, you can maybe look at some of the seasonality back to \u201819, which will show you that Q3 and Q4 have moderately lower ADR is not substantially, I think you could use that as a little bit of a guide."
