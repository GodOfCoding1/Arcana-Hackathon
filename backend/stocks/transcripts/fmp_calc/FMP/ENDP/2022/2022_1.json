    "content": " On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations was approximately $156 million or $0.66 per share on a diluted basis in the first quarter of 2022, compared to income from continuing operations of approximately $175 million or $0.73 per share on a diluted basis in the first quarter of 2021. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect total revenues to be between $500 million and $525 million, adjusted EBITDA to be between $110 million and $125 million and adjusted loss from continuing operations to be between $0.15 and $0.17 per share on a diluted basis. With respect to second quarter 2022 total revenues compared to the first quarter of 2022, our guidance range primarily reflects significant erosion in both VASOSTRICT vial price and underlying demand due to competition, lower overall vasopressin market volumes and the estimated onetime destocking impact of approximately $25 million."
