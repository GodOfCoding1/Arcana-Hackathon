    "content": " Overall, net revenue for the company in the third quarter was down 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by lower volumes due to slower end market demand, offset somewhat by positive price contribution. Within G&A, again, I think it's helpful to point out for the year-over-year comparison directly $2.4 million in cloud computing implementation costs that includes $700,000 of amortization as well as Hypercare outside health as well as the LTIP performance share amortization of roughly $4 million per quarter, which was based on the roughly $25 share price at the time of the grant. As a result of the environment and increased industry supply, we expect paper pricing to become a tailwind going into next year, which we believe should enable us to claw back some of the margin we let go off temporarily as pricing reach levels that we did not believe were sustainable given the backdrop. So if what I'm saying is correct, this thing is going to correct itself in the next few months where some of these new accounts are going to ramp up and get to the levels that we think are appropriate given the number of shipments that they're doing, and that's how we decided to place the number of machines."
