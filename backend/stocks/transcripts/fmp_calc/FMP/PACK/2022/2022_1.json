    "content": " Demand for our products was solid in the quarter and activity levels became more robust as the quarter went on, particularly in North America, which even with all the inefficiencies, had double-digit top-line growth year-over-year, driven by strong March. Overall, net revenue for the company in the first quarter was down 1.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by lower volumes of product shipped to largely SAP Go-Live, the associated inefficiency of getting up and running, and the macro-environment in Europe impacting some of our ability to catch up in March. But meaningfully improved in March due to better absorption and pricing actions going into effect, Europe and APAC was more challenging from large and standpoint down 16.1 points as energy prices impacted our material costs without any corresponding price actions to help in the quarter, automation contributed 8% of sales in the region compared to 3% prior, and we had lower PPS volumes year-over-year. Given the margin pressures to start the year and lower volume expectations due to the uncertain outlook in Europe, we have lowered our adjusted EBITDA forecast to a range of a $115 million to a $125 million on a constant currency basis or negative 2.5% to positive 6%, compared to 2021. Whether it's through a surcharge that Omar mentioned as well as other price increase just on traditional paper, Price increase -- we'll be looking to both of those mechanisms to make sure that we're calling back our margin as we exit the year Q3 and Q4 in a much better spot."
