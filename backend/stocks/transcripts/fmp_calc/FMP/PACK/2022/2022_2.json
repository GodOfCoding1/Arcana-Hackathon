    "content": " Closes in Europe in the second quarter trended upward from Q1 as well as the team has done a good job of driving activity in the field and converting new business wins, albeit at a slower rate compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frenetic pace. Overall, net revenue for the company in the second quarter was up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by positive price contribution, offset by lower volumes of product shipped due to slower end market demand. In Europe and APAC, net revenue on a constant currency basis was up 9.5% year-over-year, driven by higher price in the region and partially offset by lower volumes against the record Q2 last year, driven by exceptional e-commerce demand and industrial bounce back. We are anticipating revenues of $360 million to $375 million, reflecting a top line decline in the area of 1% to 5%, driven by estimated volume declines of more than 20% for the remainder of the year, given the challenging macro outlook, especially in Europe. So I think if you look at what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re implying from a guide standpoint, and the volumes per machine that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re implying, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at kind of 2019 levels of machine utilization and then we haircut those by 10 to 15 points depending on the product line, which we think makes sense because 2019 was kind of the last year where it was more than a normal year, right, in terms of utilization, at least by historical standards."
