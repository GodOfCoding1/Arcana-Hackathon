    "content": " Net revenue on a constant currency basis was down 9% for the year, driven by pressure in OPTS  product lines as destocking meaningfully dragged on results and uncertainty due to the war, inflation, energy and the general economy created a cautious industrial and retail operating environment. As a result of the lower sales volumes and additional cost absorbed in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA declined 64% in the quarter to $12.9 million on a constant currency basis or a 15% margin, bringing full year results to down 44% to $66.8 million, implying a 19% margin. This year on a constant currency basis, we're anticipating revenues of $365 million to $385 million, reflecting top line growth in the area of 6% to 12%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% to 29%, implying a range of $76 million to $86 million. But I believe the strategy we're taking in terms of taking care of the customers, making sure they have the right equipment for \u00e2\u0080\u009cnormalized levels\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I think that's a strategy that's going to be a wise strategy that's frankly no different than the strategy we took in the second half of last year of not passing all price increases despite the pressure that we were facing in order to protect our customer base and to make sure that they stay with us and as the world reverses, hopefully that will accrue to our benefit. And the second thing that gives us a lot of confidence, that is not 100% reflected, but a big part of it is our paper pricing and what's happening in the energy market in Europe now, we're not assuming that energy is just going to be stable, but what we're seeing in kraft paper, and we're negotiating these things, so we have visibility for the upcoming few months and quarters."
