    "content": " This increase is due to the full quarter impact of multifamily joint venture investments consolidated in the previous quarter, additional multifamily joint venture investments entered into and consolidated in the current quarter, and an increase in interest rates affecting 70% of the mortgage payable balance related to real estate or approximately 884 million of unpaid principal balance that is floating rate debt. So the flexibility that we have on our -- with the assets we have in our balance sheet that have high turnover related to fix and flip loans, also with monetization of certain strategies such as our multifamily equity portfolio, we were able to rotate these assets to higher yielding returns in a buyer's market. In fact, we're now below kind of 2019 pre-COVID levels on total delinquency base and most of the strategies that we are focused on, particularly in the RPL strategy, this is high season assets, typical origination age of these loans were pre-financial market meltdown in 2007. But, the focus is really there's a lot of origination product out there that was originated without really being priced in to deal with the financing costs increases on 30-year kind of loan product, and that's where we're seeing some of the market get stuck and where our liquidity may be used in the future."
