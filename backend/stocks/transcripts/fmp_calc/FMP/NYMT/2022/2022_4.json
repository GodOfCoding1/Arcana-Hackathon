    "content": " We intentionally focused on organic fundraisers through our portfolio to drive earnings higher in a market which presents superior risk adjust returns with a catalyst that may trigger a downturn now in view, we firmly see our differentiated patient approach as a winning one where our stockholders will benefit from a steadfast path to seeking value in a disrupted environment. The fair value changes related to our investment portfolio continued to have a significant impact on our earnings and during the quarter we recognized $0.11 per share of unreal life losses, primarily due to an increase in interest rates and credit spread widening that resulted in a decline in the fair values of our residential loans and investment in consolidated SLST. In addition, financing costs in our investment portfolio were higher due to increases in base interest rates related to our repurchase agreements and as a result of residential loan securitization that we completed in the fourth quarter. Total general, administrative and operating expenses amounted to $68.2 million for the quarter, down from $91.6 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to: one, reduction in amortization expense as a result of lease and tangibles related to consolidated real estate, being fully amortized in the prior quarter; two, reduction in depreciation expense due to the application of held-for-sale accounting to consolidated real estate in the disposal group and finally due to residential loan portfolio runoff and minimal purchase activity which reduce portfolio operating expenses. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
