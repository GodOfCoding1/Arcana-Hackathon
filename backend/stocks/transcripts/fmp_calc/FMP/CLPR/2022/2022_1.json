    "content": " As occupancy increased last year, we achieved higher rent per square foot  now have reached an excess $83 in April 22 at 35% increase over prior rents on the same units. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were 96.5% leased and new leases at our properties are reaching or exceeding pre-pandemic levels, including at Tribeca House property, where new leases -- new lease rates in April exceeded $83 per square foot, more than 35% better than the previous rents, and May rents per square foot jumped from $65 at the end of March to $66. Excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, revenue increased by $1 million from $31.7 million to $30.7 million, primarily due to increased occupancy and our residential rental rates at Tribeca House, Aspen and Clover House properties. As a result of the new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2022, residential revenue includes a charge of $700,000 for bad debt expense and commercial revenue includes a benefit of $1.1 million for the restoration of a receivable of attended previously deemed probable only a partial payment at the end of last year. In April 2022, as David and JJ articulated for example at the Tribeca House property, new residential rental rates were above $83 per square foot, well above the leases that replaced with similar increases at our other properties as well. As a result of the new accounting standard, we have no bad debt expense and operating expenses in the first quarter this year versus a charge of $1.1 million in the first quarter last year, thus causing the apparent variance in the financials."
