    "content": " We delivered another solid quarter, thanks to the strength of our brands, our operational and marketing agility, and most importantly, our seasoned team of franchisees, our Applebee's, IHOP and Dine leaders and our team members. Your line is open. Yeah, this is Jay. Your line is open. We're very confident in not only the plan that we've aligned upon, but our flexibility to change as needed when you have a very strong momentum as a brand and our confidence quite candidly couldn't be any higher than it's been over the past five years. Your line is open. And my follow up, just because it's amazing and we've gone halfway through this call without much talk about menu pricing or inflation so hoping to just touch on -- well, you mentioned the commodity basket seemingly easing a little bit in the back half of the year, I'm wondering if you could maybe talk directionally where you think commodities and labor are headed. Hey, Nick, is John C. my final point on this one and I firmly believe this, as we think about the past couple of years brands with meaningful scale, which we have in brands that have strong culture within their franchise communities, and entities, and brands that have earned the trust of their guests are going to thrive and perhaps navigate this inflationary environment better than others who don't have scale, and don't have strong culture. Your line is open. Yeah, this is Jay. Your line is open. Your line is open."
