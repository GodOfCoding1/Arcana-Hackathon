The key upcoming milestones for our program includes continued enrolment in our Phase I/Ib at the 200 milligram dose, including the use of our new biomarker, updated data from our 818 Phase I T-cell lymphoma trial will be presented at the Lugano meeting in June, meeting with FDA to discuss a randomized Phase III registration trial and from our partner-driven programs, we anticipate interim data from the trial  by mid-year."
