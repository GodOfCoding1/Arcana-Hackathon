    "content": " Examples of these collaborations are Angel Pharmaceuticals our partner in China now involved in clinical trials with CPI-818 and mupadolimab and the Kidney Cancer Consortium, which is conducting a first-line trial with ciforadenant in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab for renal cell cancer. In October, the Kidney Cancer Research Consortium initiated a Phase Ib/II clinical trial evaluating ciforadenant as a potential first-line therapy for metastatic renal cell cancer in a triplet combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab. With ciforadenant, Phase Ib/II trial for first-line renal cell cancer we have the potential for a read on clinical activity response rate early in enrollment since it is an open-label study. However, it is very, very difficult to ignore the profound effects we see in our lymphoma patients very reminiscent of what myself and my team saw, when we started treating lymphoma patients with things like Rituxan and ibrutinib, we started to notice that there were effects on other B-cells in that case in the case of ITK, it's T-cells that could really be important for a bunch of other diseases."
