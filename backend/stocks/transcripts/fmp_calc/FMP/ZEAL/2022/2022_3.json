    "content": " As Adam has already mentioned, in September, we were extremely pleased to release positive top line results from the EASE-1 pivotal Phase 3 trial of glepaglutide in SBS patients. From baseline, the glepaglutide twice-weekly treatment resulted in both rapid and continued reductions in parenteral support with an average reduction of 5.13 liters per week at the end of the 24 weeks of study as compared with a reduction of 2.85 liters per week for those treated with placebo. The results presented at EASD in September demonstrated that treatment with BI 456906 led to dose-dependent lowering of hemoglobin A1C by up to 1.88% at 16 weeks, while treatment with open-label semaglutide used in the same trial resulted in a reduction in A1C of 1.47%. In the same study, treatment with this novel glucagon GLP-1 receptor agonist for 16 weeks resulted in dose-dependent reductions in body weight of up to 9% after treatment with BI 456906, while those treated with open-label semaglutide had a 5.4% decline in body weight. but first and foremost, our goal is to bring this forth for the intestinal failure patients and population with, again, the encouraging finding that a number of individuals on active glepaglutide treatment, we're able to completely discontinue that parenteral support, which we believe is a significant part of this data set. Dear speakers, there are no further questions at this time. Dear speakers, there are no further questions at this time."
