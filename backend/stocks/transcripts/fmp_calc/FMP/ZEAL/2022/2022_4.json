    "content": " Shown on Slide 6, we estimate that there are up to 800 children with diffuse CHI that may be eligible for dasiglucagon treatment in the U.S. To the right of the slide, we present examples of other products targeting ultrarare diseases with high clinical burden that commands premium pricing in the U.S. And if approved, we do believe that dasiglucagon has the potential to provide comparable clinical value, thus also representing a significant opportunity for Zealand. You are right that now they actually allowed us and informed us that, first of all, they expect to share the data in the coming months from the obesity Phase II study and that they are having parallel discussions on Phase III planning for overweight to obese individuals with health authorities in our mind, that's, of course, a stronger messaging than what we have done before but it is in line, it's a step forward in the messaging, and it just underscores the confidence we believe that Boehringer have the program and also have towards the opportunity to move into Phase III. And secondly, also that at that point in time, Boehringer will have like clarifications of the ongoing discussions regarding Phase III plans with the regulatory authorities, i.e., that they would also like to be able to communicate around ADA whether it's a go or no-go decision to start the Phase III."
