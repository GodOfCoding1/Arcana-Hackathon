    "content": " With a new commercial partnership strategy and a more streamlined organization, we are financially well-positioned to achieve our goals in the next few years, which includes the potential for three more commercialized products and a highly valued product pipeline, including programs targeting diabetes, obesity, chronic inflammation, leveraging our strong and innovative peptide platform. For our additional late-stage dasiglucagon programs, our partner Beta Bionics initiated the Phase 3 program for dasiglucagon in the Bihormonal Artificial Pancreas Pump for the management of type 1 diabetes in late 2021 and we expect that the first thousand patients will be dosed later in this year. We expect 2022 to be a catalyst-rich year and we look forward to sharing data from our Phase 3 studies evaluating dasiglucagon in CHI and glepaglutide in SBS, along with updates from our ongoing Phase 3 study of the dasiglucagon Bihormonal Pancreas Pump and progress on our obesity portfolio."
