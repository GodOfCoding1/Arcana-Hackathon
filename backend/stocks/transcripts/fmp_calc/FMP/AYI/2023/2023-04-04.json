    "content": " ABL's operating profit was $124 million, an increase of 6% versus the prior year with ABL adjusted operating profit at $133 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. Sales in the second quarter of 2023 were $58 million, an increase of $8 million or 16% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the growth in Distech. We generated $306 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, an increase of $179 million over the prior year's first half, driven largely by improvements in working capital. I just want to come back to just kind of the lending environment, Neil, not to parse words here but in your opening remarks, it actually sounded like you felt the negative impact of lending changing already in the quarter but really, it sounds more like you're just flagging it as obviously an issue to be concerned about and the order softening was more of this compression of lead times."
