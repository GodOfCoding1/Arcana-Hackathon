    "content": " We feel like those product vitality and increasing the service levels are foundational to our long-term performance, and they've driven -- they've obviously served us well in an inflationary environment, and I think they're going to be equally as important in a more normalized environment. Your line is now open. On the acquisition front, I believe that as we look forward over the next year or two years, we are better positioned to integrate -- execute, integrate and manage additional businesses based on all the work that we've done around better, smarter, faster the -- and the rest of the company. Your line is now open. As Karen indicated, we expect to work through the first part of next year with continued inconsistency in some component availability, which impacts our ability to level load the factories, one and two, some higher cost inventory related to that's in inventory right now related to higher container cost historically, but we feel pretty solid about where we're going for next year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So while it allowed us to take volume in this choppy market of 2020 or 2022, as we look forward, I think what we're doing is building a more consistent position in the marketplace where contractors, distributors, lighting specifiers know that we have the highest quality and highest value products for them and we can service them on a consistent basis, which I believe will bode well for us from a share and margin perspective going forward. Your line is now open. As it relates to kind of trade-downs in the inflationary environment, that is something that obviously is always happening, but I would tell you as anecdotally that the performance of our architectural portfolio, so the things which are -- I think we would all generally consider more at the top of our product portfolio has been stronger this year than certainly in any time since I've been at the company. We are significantly more healthy across the portfolio -- our portfolio at the high to the middle end and the more value components, which is how we've delivered, kind of, the volume, the margin, and the mix as you see it, and that's what we feel good about going forward. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
