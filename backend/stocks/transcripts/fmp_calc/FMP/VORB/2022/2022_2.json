    "content": " We continue to capitalize on the growing space sector by targeting higher value missions and payloads while also executing on the growing markets of responsive launch, international space ports, missile defense and hypersonics. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022 improved sequentially by $15 million and was a loss of $34.4 million driven mainly by timing of lower launch cost of revenue, which will be recognized in Q3 along with the associated revenue from the straight up mission as well as lower R&D and SG&A costs. And so we have areas that we are penetrating the market and that frankly others don't have access to, whether it's international space ports and the ability to convert an airport into a space port, the possibility and the high level businesses associated with missile defense and hypersonics, and the kinds of experimentation that's done using air launch today where we can achieve it in a straightforward manner with our system."
