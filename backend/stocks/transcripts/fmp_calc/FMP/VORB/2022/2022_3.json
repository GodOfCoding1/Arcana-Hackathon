    "content": " We continue to work closely across the national security community to enable tactically responses space through our air launch technology, which has recognized distinct advantages in this mission area. Overall, we continue to capitalize on our position in the growing space sector by targeting commercial multi-launch agreements, international space ports, high-value government payloads, responsive launch and other national security missions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to do first as a company, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to demonstrate our differentiation as an air launch platform, and drive open markets, which is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing really in the international and the defense side as well. In addition, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing developments in the national security area and with our differentiated capability, we have not only a traditional launch, but as we just discussed, tactically responsive launch as well as inroads into hypersonic R&D and missile defense target areas, which other launches don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have nearly as much of an opportunity for. I mean, that's how space grew up in the U.S. Our services vary from a campaign and doing a launch to something like what we're doing here, where there's ground equipment and some infrastructure associated with it, and we can sell and maintain infrastructure, ground equipment that services and fuels our rocket to an airplane that's permanently stationed and supplying a full turnkey system."
