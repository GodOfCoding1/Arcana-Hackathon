    "content": " The diversification of our businesses allowed us to have strong results, although mining was impacted by the drop of prices in the quarter, a spotlight on the cement segment, which presented record results with a recovery of prices. EBITDA reached BRL 3 billion, with a variation of 1.5 negative in mining, offset by a stable quarter in steel with good volumes and an increase in prices and margins, very close to a record. And in terms of raw material, we went through the first and second quarters with the price of coal and coke that were record prices and are now more normalized with a better production. And in the first quarter of the year, besides a high working capital, seasonality of payments, income tax, because we had a very strong year in '21 with cash disbursements, we now go to more normal quarters, BRL 830 million in adjusted free cash flow, with an outlook for a clear increase. When it comes to price realization, we had the double impact of the drop in iron ore. Not only the price of the quarter suffered with indices that went from 140 to 120, and the open shipments because of a reversion and the sea freight that was at $23 and went to $29, an impact on price, and this was the main impact in our realization of EBITDA close to BRL 900 million and a margin of 5%. We're going to fight more in the markets of interest where we have zinc products and domestic products vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis imported products, and we have 8% to 10% sales more in the third quarter than in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we preferred prices over volume. In the second quarter, we preferred prices over volume."
