    "content": " For the quarter, factoring in no amelioration of the grocer issue, we expect prescription transactions revenue to decline approximately 8% to 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue to grow 60% to 70% year-over-year, pharma manufacturing solutions to approximately double year-over-year with additional upside as I just discussed, and other revenues to grow 10% to 15%. That -- as your question, I think, alludes to, that creates a lot of additional monetization opportunities in the future beyond the already extremely fast-growing businesses of pharma manufacturer solutions, subscriptions and these other areas of our business that are growing at such quick speeds and also being one of the largest HCP platforms, where we are 90 NPS with consumers and providers, all of this provides unique and interesting monetization possibilities, which we are delivering on in -- across these different segments and with different parts of the ecosystem."
