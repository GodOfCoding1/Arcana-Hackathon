    "content": " At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, our inventory increased by approximately $26.2 million or roughly 18% from the same period a year ago, reflecting our preparations for significant growth in coming quarters with much of the inventory increase being associated with the previously announced large outdoor power equipment program. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, trade receivables were up about $12.6 million from the same period a year ago, and our DSOs also increased to about 91 days up from 83 days from the same period a year ago, which reflects timing of shipments to customers with extended terms and some delays and payments from customers who have been impacted by pandemic related slowdowns and restarts in their respective markets."
