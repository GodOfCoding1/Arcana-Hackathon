    "content": " While expense growth was elevated for the reasons we noted in our fourth quarter call, both our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO grew more than 25% in the quarter, both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share we're well ahead of pre-pandemic levels. The company achieved AFFO growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, improving 30.4% to $1.50 per share on a fully diluted basis versus Q1 2021. Acquisition adjusted operating expenses increased 14.8% in the first quarter, driven primarily by variable expenses tied to revenue as well as corporate initiatives discussed on our last call. Local and regional sales accounted for 80% of our billboard revenue in the first quarter, with growth outpacing the national and programmatic channel for the first time since Q1 of last year. Because of the company's improving AFFO outlook, management's recommendation at the upcoming Board meeting will be to declare a cash dividend of $1.20 per share for the second quarter. If the Board approves management's recommendation and assuming a $1.20 dividend for each of Q2, Q3 and Q4, Lamar's distribution for the full year will total $4.70 per share, which is 17.5% above the dividend paid in 2021 and represents a yield of 4.3% as of yesterday's closing stock price."
