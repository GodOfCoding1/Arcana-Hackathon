    "content": " At the course -- in the course of this discussion, Lamar may make forward-looking statements regarding the company, including statements about its future financial performance, strategic goals, plans and objectives, including with respect to the amount and timing of the distribution of stockholders and the impacts and effects of general economic conditions including inflationary pressures on the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Let's turn to the second quarter where we once again saw strong growth across all business lines and geographies, with billboard revenue up more than 10% on an acquisition-adjusted basis. And we think it's likely that those growth rates will normalize to around 3% to 5% top line growth, and we expect expense growth, which you saw was above trend in Q2 to normalize also as we finish '22 and round into 2023. The company achieved AFFO growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, improving 10.9% to $1.94 per share on a fully diluted basis. Because of the company's improving AFFO outlook, we increased the second quarter dividend to $1.20 per share, a 9% increase over Q1. If the Board approves management's recommendation and assuming a $1.20 dividend for Q4, Lamar's distribution for the full-year will total $4.70 per share, which is 17.5% above the company's dividend paid in 2021 and represents a yield of 4.7% as of yesterday's closing stock price."
