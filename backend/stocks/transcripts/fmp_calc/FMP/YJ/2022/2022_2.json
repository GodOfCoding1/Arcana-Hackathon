During the second quarter, we successfully navigated through the uncertainties and the volatility for about by the challenging macro backdrop, widespread resurgences of the pandemic and related control measures affected a number of major cities across China.

Our private label product inventory has now been delivered, securing sufficient stock for merchandise sales during the last two quarters. Furthermore, we have taken pre-emptive measures to mitigate potential future COVID-related supply chain disruptions by increasing our inventories of a private label product and cross-border merchandise. During the first half of this year, we adhere to our strategy often developing inclusive private label products, actively enriched our productive offerings and developed a variety of fresh user centric product. During the first half of 2020, we developed more than 10 original new products for weight management, skincare and body revitalization under our private label. Our second-generation fruit and vegetable pressed candy reaching the milestone of five million sales within one minute and 10 million sales within 20 minutes upon it launch on June the 14, 2022. On the cosmetics front, we carry out fresh content marketing and brand development initiative for our private label skincare brand SUYE. As part of these efforts, we appointed our popular Chinese female celebrity as a brand spokesperson for our new product line campaign ingredients used in mesotherapy treatments. This concept, which is also visually illustrated and amplified in our food category short video marketing content. That it is the expectation.. As in time, we constantly try to provide more authority services to inspire customers as such, we have enhanced our own service system while launching more value-added services. We are great instead it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provision in our healthcare categories, community groups by piloting a nutritional consulting service where users are provided with professional advice and feedback for these pilot service, we designated professional nutrition to cover each community group and organized in my live streaming group classes with a team of professionals and sports experts. During this period, 90.6% of the 12 users were successfully retained and they engaged with nutritionist on a daily basis. Looking ahead, in order to deliver every higher level of service to our users, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll increase investment in the development of service managers. During the second half of this year, having implemented very strategic initiative to reduce costs, improve operating efficiency, and develop private label brand product over the past year, our gross margin has improved significantly. Before I go through our financial results, please note that all numbers stated in the following remarks are in RMB terms, and all comparisons and percentage changes are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Compared to the same period last year, our repurchase rate remained relatively stable at 79% and our gross margin improved even in the face of this headwind. We intensify our focus on optimizing cost structures and developing our private label brands, enabling our business to navigate safely through the present macro uncertainties. Furthermore, we invested in our fulfillment partner base to ensure the delivery of product even within areas on the strict pandemic control measures. The pandemic related lockdowns disrupted our supply chain with our third-party suppliers, merchants and logistics service providers being particularly effective. These factors combined to create merchandise strategies, logistical delays, and stagnating consumer demand of which negatively affected our operations during the first half of 2022. Despite these challenges, we improve our gross margin to 40.6% compared to 35.1% a year ago as a result of sustain customer loyalty to our private labels and effective product curation strategy. Sales and marketing expense were 58 million compared to 61 million a year ago, mainly due to the decrease in member management fee, which was partially mitigated by increased in private label promotion expenses. As of June 30, 2022, we had a total 645 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. Compared to 743 million as of March 31, 2022, the decrease was partially caused by cash using our share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2022, we have repurchased over 6 million American depository shares representing over 60 million Class A ordinary shares from the open market with cash flow and aggregate amount of approximately 7 million. While we face the significant macro challenges in the first half of 2022, we are confident that our resilience and flexible business model, updated supply chain improved product curation and optimized cost structure will power growth regardless of future uncertainties. We have achieved solid progress and we expect to carry the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 optimize the cost structure into the post pandemic year, which we believe we will bring long-term value to our shareholders. For us live streaming is more like a content marketing than direct sales, especially for private label promotions. That is also a kind of content sharing, live streaming and short videos make sharing more vivid. Later, we will also try to organize live streaming sales on these accounts to promote private label products and Yunji belongs to the high quality supply chain."
