    "content": " Our solid profitability, strong performing remaining business lines and emerging new business initiatives in this quarter have again strengthened our confidence in preferring innovative endeavors and profitable growth through the rest of the year. Breaking down, the overseas test prep business recorded a revenue increase of 17% in dollar terms or 30% in RMB terms year-over-year for the second quarter. Looking ahead into the rest of fiscal year 2023, with the restructuring process largely completed and our new business in their early stage, we expect our school network and geographic coverage to stabilize. And the new business within the schools, we started the new business last year -- the year before last year, right, November 2020. yes, in the last fiscal year. Actually, the new pandemic situation with the gradual opening up after these recent developments of the new situation, I think probably we can see more opportunities in some certain kind of new initiatives such as the study tour and research camping business that we mentioned one to two quarters ago that as one of the new initiative. And the school business, including our remaining like high school business and also the new initiatives for younger students together contributing roughly over 40% of total revenue. Actually, since the government has issued the policy last year, I think we have been actively exploring the new business direction and follow all the central and local government authorities, the rules. And even for the next new year, fiscal year 2024, I would believe the business of the new -- the revenue growth of the new business will be high yes."
