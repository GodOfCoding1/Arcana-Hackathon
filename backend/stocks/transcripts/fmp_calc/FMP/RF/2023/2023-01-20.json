    "content": " Earlier this morning, we reported full year earnings of $2.1 billion, reflecting record pretax pre-provision income of $3.1 billion, adjusted positive operating leverage of 7% and industry-leading returns on both average tangible common equity and total shareholder return. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew to a record $1.4 billion this quarter, representing an 11% increase while reported net interest margin increased 46 basis points to 3.99%, its highest level in the last 15 years. In terms of your deposit beta, regarding that 35% beta assumption by year-end \u00e2\u0080\u009823, what is your -- maybe help us think about what your assumption is around noninterest-bearing mix as a percentage of total deposits. Classified loans are increasing toward levels that we would expect to be more \"normalized\" and the categories in which that -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing that change are the 5 identified, but there are some odds and ends in the portfolio as well as inflationary impacts and rising rates affect isolated customers. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased with -- despite the fact that we had a bit of a soft quarter in the fourth quarter, really pleased with the contribution that those capital markets investments are making to help us continue to strengthen relationships with customers and grow noninterest revenues up pretty dramatically over the last 6 or 7 years."
