    "content": " Net income was $69 million, compared to $39.4 million last year and adjusted EBITDA was $113.7 million, compared to $77.7 million in the second quarter last year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $78 million, compared to $46.1 million in the second quarter of last year. For the six month period, net cash provided by operating activities was $141.6 million, compared to $20.1 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $124.5 million in the current year, compared to free cash use of $4 million last year, an improvement of $128.5 million reflecting the company\u2019s recovery from the pandemic, the cost savings initiatives implemented last year and a first quarter tax refund. Domestic inventory purchases for the fiscal year of $172.4 million increased $20.7 million over last year\u2019s purchases, but still remain substantially below historical levels, as the company was able to leverage inventory on hand and continues to improve processes and tools to manage inventory levels as demand changes. Operating income performance was stronger still, but quarterly operating income of $15.6 million exceeding the prior year performance of $10.3 million. Magazine revenue and subscription rates have come back strong post-pandemic, but quarterly revenue from magazines exceeding the prior year by $2.7 million."
