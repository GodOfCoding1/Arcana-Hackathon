    "content": " Ken will provide greater detail as usual, but I'm pleased to share that revenues for the third quarter grew 24% to $344.5 million versus $277.5 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow for the quarter was $23.4 million compared to $5.5 million last year, demonstrating continued discipline and increased revenues on a lower cost base. For the nine-month period, net cash provided by operating activities was $178.5 million compared to $36.5 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $147.9 million in the current year compared to a free cash flow of $1.5 million last year, an improvement of $146.4 million, reflecting the company's continued recovery from the pandemic, the cost-savings initiatives implemented last year and a first quarter tax refund. Trade continued its strong run as revenues of $84.5 million exceeded the revenues of $80.8 million in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4.6%, largely driven by strong demand for backlist titles as our series publishing continues to resonate with young readers. Third quarter Book Clubs revenues of $40.5 million exceeded the prior year's comparable period reported revenue of $35.1 million as we worked down the bulk of our previously discussed backlog in December. Total Children's Book Publishing and Distribution revenues for the current quarter of $201 million exceeded the prior year's period revenues of $142.9 million, and operating income of $5 million improved over the prior year's period operating loss of $4.7 million as a result of the increased revenue and cost-containment efforts. As Peter mentioned, we have commenced execution of our distribution contract with the state of Florida, which is now fully operational and operating within the state, which accounted for $5.7 million of revenue in this fiscal year's third quarter."
