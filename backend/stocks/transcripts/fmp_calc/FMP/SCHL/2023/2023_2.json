    "content": "  Segment operating income decreased $2 million, reflecting higher inflationary costs related to freight, paper, fuel and labor in major markets, and economic conditions in Canada and the U.K. As I previously discussed, we are confident in our ability to continue navigating the current business environment and are affirming our fiscal 2023 guidance for adjusted EBITDA of $195 million to $205 million based on our momentum in the first half of the year and expectations for a strong fourth quarter, following a seasonally smaller third quarter."
