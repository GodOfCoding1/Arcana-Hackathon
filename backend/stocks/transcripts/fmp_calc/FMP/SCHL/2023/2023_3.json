    "content": " While children's retail book sales have historically been less cyclical than other areas of discretionary consumer spending, some of the year-over-year decline in the third quarter may reflect a one-time return to pre-pandemic purchasing patterns by our retail partners and then customers. Free cash use for the nine month period was $25.7 million compared to free cash flow of $147.9 million last year, with successfully acquired inventory during the first half of this year in anticipation of increased sales and longer lead times, which has enabled the growth we've seen in children's books. Now turning to our segment results; in children's book publishing and distribution, revenues for the third quarter of $204 million exceeded the prior year's revenues of $201 million."
