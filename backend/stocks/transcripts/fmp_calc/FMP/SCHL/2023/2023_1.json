    "content": " In advance of Ken's detailed walk-through of our first quarter of fiscal year 2023, I am pleased to share that results are in-line with our plan for top and bottom line growth in 2023, with lower year-over-year operating income and earnings as expected, primarily reflecting increased investments in growth initiatives in our education business and a return to more typical seasonal revenue patterns post pandemic, as I'll discuss in a moment. In short, we are off to a strong start to our fiscal year and we are therefore affirming our guidance of $1.8 billion of annual revenue and $195 million to $205 million of adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 as we balance growth initiatives, were current returns for our shareholders. This year, given the long lead times required for procurement of product, we used our strong balance sheet to acquire inventory earlier and our first quarter domestic inventory purchases increased to $152.2 million from $76.5 million in fiscal 2022. First quarter Book Clubs revenue of $6.3 million was flat to the prior year's comparable period reported revenue of $6.8 million, but it's not significant as schools were not in session. Unallocated overhead costs of $20.2 million in this year's current fiscal quarter were flat to prior year's fiscal quarter unallocated cost of $20.5 million, as we continue to tightly control discretionary spending."
