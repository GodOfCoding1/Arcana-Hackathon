    "content": " Yes, Travis, on the -- sorry, on the guidance question, when we put together our 2023 guidance, we really tried to contemplate all of these factors that are going into the business this year, such as the ability to grow our two sort of core VTE markets, the new TAMs that we're sort of focused on for the year, specifically that's made available with ProTrieve and InThrill. And I think because of that, you're going to see further publications that distinguish our treatments, FlowTriever and ClotTriever from other similar mechanical thrombectomy approaches, which is why I believe Inari is going to get the nod in terms of specific mention in guidelines. If you look at the penetration within that broad group of patients of any interventional therapy today, both legacy lytic-based interventions as well as mechanical thrombectomy interventions like Inari, we believe in both DVT and PE, the interventional penetration is still somewhere between 10% and 15%, very, very modest, vast majority of patients still getting treated with conservative medical management and coagulation alone."
