    "content": " And I think as we get into the first part of next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to find ways to update you on the progress that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making with those two new products and their acceptance in the marketplace. And those two products, obviously that was some revenue in Q2 that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear in Q3, but we are pleased with the performance of the ClotTriever franchise in Q3 and the procedure growth and the other things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d normally be looking at to sort of make sure we have a healthy and growing business there. I mean I think as we were looking at Q4, obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased with the opportunities that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard us describe including the new products in the field, which are sort of getting out there into the hospital. And then just I was wondering if you could give us some qualitative just on I think historically you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about accounts and a new count adds, kind of where are you in that transition of bringing on new accounts versus going in deeper and if you could quantify maybe the new account growth on a percentage basis year-over-year and then just lastly for me, as any commentary on ASP trends. At the same time, BOLD is also I think giving us access for the first time to that new chronic venous disease patient population, patients that have truly chronic clot that is months or even years old, and that BOLD is strong enough to try and address the underlying cause of their disease."
