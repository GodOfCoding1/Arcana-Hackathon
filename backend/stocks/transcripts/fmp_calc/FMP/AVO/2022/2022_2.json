    "content": " The backdrop of constrained supply coupled with consistent demand continued to create sustained upward pressure on pricing through the first half of this fiscal year, where prices were approximately 50% higher versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $16.3 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by lower avocado volume sold and higher SG&A costs as described previously. So with this in mind, for the second quarter International Farming segment net sales increased $2.1 million or 91% due to higher mango harvest volumes, as well as higher third-party service revenue compared to the same period last year. The industry\u2019s expecting third quarter volumes to increase sequentially, but remain approximately 10% to 15% lower versus the prior year period, primarily due to ongoing supply constraints in Mexico that are not expected to fully alleviate until the fiscal fourth quarter. And then if I could sneak in one more question on the demand side, have you guys seen any consumer demand, I\u2019ll say like a price umbrella where once the fruit prices hit a certain point, they either swap out of the category or the volume sees decrement not related to supply, but just related to consumer pricing power specifically maybe at some of the QSR restaurants at Chipotle."
