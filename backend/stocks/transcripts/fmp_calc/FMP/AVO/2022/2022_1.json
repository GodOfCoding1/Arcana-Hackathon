    "content": " Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 25% to $216.6 million, as compared to $173.2 million for the same period last year. SG&A for the first quarter increased $4.1 million to $18.7 million, due primarily to non-capitalizable costs associated with the implementation of our new ERP system in the Marketing & Distribution segment, which included approximately $1 million of consulting costs incurred during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $10.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to a positive $12.5 million for the same period last year, driven primarily by the lower gross margin and higher SG&A costs described previously. Net cash used in operating activities was $41.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $9.7 million in the same period last year. Further, our current expectations are for pricing to be steady to slightly higher on a sequential basis to fiscal first quarter, which would imply a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% to 15%, compared to the $1.42 per pound average we experienced in the second quarter of the prior year. We talk about the investments we\u2019ve made in capacity in our network over the last year, particularly at the border for Mexican fruit and then having the first year come around and actually see volume declines for fruit that are coming into the U.S. market have certainly created headwinds for us."
