    "content": " Similarly, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $9.2 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $17 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the same period of last year and adjusted EBITDA was $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $26.4 million for the same period last year due primarily to lower per unit gross margins and higher SG&A costs noted above, partially offset by the impact of higher avocado volumes sold."
