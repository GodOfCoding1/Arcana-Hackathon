    "content": " We produced strong revenue growth of 27% to $313.2 million, and we generated $31.6 million in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, which was supported by sustained strength in pricing amid a lower industry supply backdrop. Third quarter gross profit increased $1.7 million or 4% compared to the same period last year to $42.6 million, and gross profit percentage decreased 300 basis points to 13.6% of revenue. SG&A for the third quarter increased $3.4 million to $20.6 million due primarily to higher employee-related costs, driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and labor inflation as well as non-capitalizable costs associated with the implementation of our new ERP system in our Marketing and Distribution segment. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $18.4 million or $0.26 per diluted share, which was essentially flat with the prior year period. Similarly, adjusted net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was consistent with the prior year at $18.9 million or $0.27 per diluted share. With that, our Marketing and Distribution segment net sales increased 29% to $308.9 million for the quarter, and segment adjusted EBITDA was $15.5 million, an 18% increase from prior year. So, with this in mind, total segment sales in the International Farming segment decreased $1.5 million or 2% for the quarter compared to the same period last year, due primarily to lower third-party service revenue. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million, a 4% decrease from prior year, primarily due to inflationary pressures on input costs in our farming and packing operations in Peru. However, on a year-to-date basis, given the seasonal nature of our working capital, net cash used in operating activities was $3 million for the first 9 months of fiscal 2022 compared to cash provided of $15.2 million in the same period last year."
