    "content": " The total full year dividend is $2.53 per share, meaning we are returning $4.8 billion to shareholders at a full year yield of over 10% based on Friday's closing share price. So Mark, one of the things that we do extensively is take a look at scenarios around how the world's energy mix might change over time, and it's probably shown on that Slide 31 that's got those graphs on it, which shows that in all scenarios, oil continues to be an important part of the energy mix for the next 30 years. So, the way we look at it at a point in time, at the time of assessing the dividend and declaring the dividend, so it's a bit early to call that out just yet, but I guess where we are today with the dividend at the 80%, it takes into account two things one is the CapEx that we have in front of us and nothing new there, the $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Just I guess going back to prior questioning, the free cash flow outlook you presented for the business at the Investor Day, is just under $1 billion or thereabouts in '23 and about $4 billion in '24 before thinking about a couple of billion dollars for Trion and H2OK CapEx."
