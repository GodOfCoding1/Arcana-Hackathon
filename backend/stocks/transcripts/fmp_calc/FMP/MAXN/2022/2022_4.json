    "content": " Previously, we indicated that getting from gross margin breakeven to 15% assume the following key levers: transitioning to higher ASP utility-scale contracts, fully ramping our 1.8 gigawatt performance line facilities, increasing U.S. residential sales and growing beyond the panel in Europe, all while benefiting to some degree from supply chain cost improvements. We also expect to see ASP improvement due to adjustments in some of our utility scale, supply agreements as well as the impact of our first quarter of shipments through Maxeon's new residential channel, together with improved pricing with SunPower. We expect total CapEx for the year to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million for the completion of manufacturing capacity for performance line channels to be sold into the U.S. market, completion of manufacturing capacity for our Maxeon 6 product platform. For those parts of our business that are not contracted at fixed terms, we feel well positioned due to diversified and growing demand in Europe and the U.S. 2023 full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $80 million and $100 million, achieving margin levels consistent with our long-term financial model before we exit the year. And one moment for our next question, please. And I totally get it, but as a quick follow-up there, you did share a little bit last quarter and just on a forward-looking basis, given the announcement earlier this year, I got to imagine incrementally, there's more volume to SunPower than you guys had expected perhaps from the end of 2022. One moment for our next question, please. And one moment for our next question, please. One moment for our next question, please. And one moment for our next question, please."
