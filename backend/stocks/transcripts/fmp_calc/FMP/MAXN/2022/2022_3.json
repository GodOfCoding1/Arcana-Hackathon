    "content": " The initial results are very encouraging and we believe we're just starting to scratch the surface of this opportunity  Overall, DG sales in Q3 we're up 25% year over year as we benefited from additional price increases and a higher mix of our Maxon six product, which is now replaced all of our previous Maxon five capacity Europe set new volume and revenue records for the six consecutive quarter. In the third quarter, our growth loss is attributable to our new US utility scale business where we are still seeing underutilization in our partially rent facilities and other startup expenses that impact cogs as well as below market ASPs from our first half 2021 bookings manufacturing volume of our Malaysian performance line sales rep and North American increased materially during the quarter, but were both still well below the target capacity that we plan to reach in 2023. I'm kind of blanking on the name, and then it's a little bit cloudy in my mind, but I feel like there were some other ones I saw talking specifically about either IBC or maybe just some, some other sort of form of back contact and of course I know, Panasonic and LG they left the IDC market or walked away from their offerings because of the patents you guys have and how they had to do, additional process steps and everything that basically made it uneconomic for them. Just kind of those sort of specifics around technology, patent, trend of that versus pop con and, and other architectures and the updates there would just be really helpful because I know you have an advantage there and you've got good patents, but again, like I said, I think I sort of qualitatively feel like I saw a little bit of an uptake and just some other name saying, Hey, we're going to do an IBC thing."
