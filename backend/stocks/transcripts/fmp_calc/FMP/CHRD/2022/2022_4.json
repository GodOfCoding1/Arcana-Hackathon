    "content": " And Chord's solid outlook allowed us to enact a progressive shareholder returns framework, which resulted in returning over 75% of adjusted free cash flow in the second half of 2022 through a combination of base and variable dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. On a pro forma basis, for the full year, Chord generated approximately $1.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow and returned over $1.2 billion or approximately 93% through dividends, cash merger consideration and share repurchases. Taking our best view, which does incorporate significant year-on-year inflation that we have experienced, we expect to invest approximately $825 million to $865 million of capital in 2023, which is inline with consensus once accounting for the roughly $20 million of capital pushed from the fourth quarter of last year, which I discussed previously."
