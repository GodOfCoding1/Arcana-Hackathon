    "content": " On capital and operating synergies, we see multiple opportunities to leverage each company's proven strength in areas such as shortening well downtime, running a more efficient workover program, reducing drilling days, improving well completions, optimizing facility design and construction, and many other aspects of the business. Thanks for the question Derrick, I'm going to maybe talk about our integration process and the synergies we're seeing broadly, and then ask Chip to maybe add some additional detail and maybe identify one or two areas that we think may be driving this, but I'll tell you honestly, Derrick it's a lot of little things. We think we've got a significant inventory depth and great position, but if we see opportunities to make our company better and deliver and deliver more value to our shareholders, that's something we're absolutely going to look at. So generally speaking, I think we feel like we've got about 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of -- 10 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of inventory from a development pace perspective, and obviously if we see opportunities to bolt on and increase that and it makes sense for us to do so, we're going to be very inquisitive about those types of things, but the inventory depth is pretty significant as we stand the day. So I think really that's why we've got that 75% plus out there because in, in very low leverage scenarios, we would anticipate returning it's a very significant portion of our pre-cash-flow shareholders."
