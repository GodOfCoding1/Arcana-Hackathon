    "content": " I think in part also driven by the complexity of the environment and the new media opportunities available to them on platforms like Netflix and TikTok and retail media platforms, as well as the transformation in WPP's business and expansion we've made in new areas around data, technology and e-commerce. But generally speaking, I mean, say for example in 2023 we would, I think at the moment, we say it's margin neutral even though there's a slight tailwind from, sort of, currency on the top line. I think if you were to look at what's the sort of normalized basis, I mean I think if you define your sort of free cash flow, taking account of your CapEx, your tax, your interest, your earn-outs, your restructuring costs and closing working capital, then we should be normalizing at around GBP 1 billion plus or so against top line of just over GBP 2 billion. So that would be -- and certainly, if I look to, say, '23 as an example, with, if you like, headline EBITDA at GBP 2.1 billion, we're creating free cash flow of around GBP 800 million."
