    "content": " So I think what we said about this year and what we said about next year is not dissimilar from what our peers have said, which is broadly speaking, a strong demand in the first half of the year, no significant cuts by clients, likely to be a somewhat slower second half than first half and an uncertain 2023. I think, Tim, just to -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s John, just to build on Mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments as well that sort of 32% digital growth coming down to 12% digital growth, I think, to your point, also reflects SMEs and also reflects the Chinese market, both of which from a market perspective, we sort of under-index in relative to the size of the market. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- I mean, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re baking a slightly better second half than first half in China, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think our numbers depend on a massive -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively small part of our business. Well, I think continuing to invest -- actually, if I look across our major clients and if I were to sort of list them, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, Unilever, Coca-Cola, P&G, L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Or\u00c3\u00a9al, Mondelez, in the FMCG category; if I look at those in the technology category, Google, Microsoft; or in pharma, Pfizer, I think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all strong companies with a desire to build their brand and continue to invest."
