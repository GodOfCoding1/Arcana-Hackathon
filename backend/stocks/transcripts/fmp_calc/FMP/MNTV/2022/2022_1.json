    "content": " More than 2,100 organizational customers are now spending more than $25,000 per year with Momentive, and 700 plus sales-assisted customers are using multiple products, both metrics increasing significantly year-over-year. It's why average customer sizes for sales-assisted core product customers, excluding our newer high velocity sales motion have increased for eight straight quarters and grew 15 plus percent year-over-year in Q1. First, over the past three years, we've focused on aligning price-to-value for self-serve customers, led by meaningful pricing and packaging experiments to our user base, amending entitlements of both free users and paid users. Deferred revenue increased 15% to approximately $216.2 million and remaining performance obligations or RPO, which is the sum of deferred revenue and backlog rose 20% to $245.4 million partially driven by continued traction winning larger multi year customer commitments. And that might mean users who are coming to use the free product, but driving value in our panel, the paid seeds, the team's products, the SurveyMonkey enterprise customers, up to market research and multi-product customer. So this $200 million revenue run rate we're seeing approaching, we believe that 30 plus percent growth is sustainable, because it's a massive market, our products have never had better product market fit. I love seeing companies like one football, which started with a single survey product, scaled dramatically became a SurveyMonkey enterprise customer, looking at everything from their customer service experience to product improvements, pricing, just raise $300 million to expand their growth."
