    "content": " After a thorough review of our business, we've concluded that our best path forward is to: one, further lower our cost structure across the organization; two, focus our resources on the products that win, retain and expand with customers most effectively; and three, standardize our most important offerings onto our core platform and one pricing model. Our go-forward plan includes the following: reducing our workforce by approximately 14%, which impacts all major functions of the organization; shifting our customer experience product focus away from GetFeedback and making SurveyMonkey Enterprise our CX solution for new and expansion customers; transitioning our market research sales-assisted products to a subscription model; and prioritizing free user engagement and paid user growth in self-serve by providing more features in our free offering and more affordable options in our paid plans."
