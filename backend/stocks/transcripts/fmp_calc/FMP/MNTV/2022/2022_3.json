    "content": " For Q3, revenue of $121.4 million increased 6% year-over-year and was at the midpoint of our guidance range, as both our sales-assisted and sales-serve go-to-market channels delivered revenue in line with our expectations. We had a record level of expansion bookings in Q3, which helped us end the quarter with more than 2,240 customers spending more than $25,000 annually with us, up 25% and approximately 900 customers using more than one of our products. We expect full year 2022 total revenue in the range of approximately $479 million to $481 million, which assumes sales-assisted channel revenue growth in the mid-20s and roughly flat self-serve channel revenue growth. We expect full year free cash flow in the range of negative $5 million to negative $10 million, which includes the impact of approximately $33 million in one-time transaction-related and restructuring expenses, a portion of which was accrued as expenses in 2021, that resulted in cash outflows in 2022."
