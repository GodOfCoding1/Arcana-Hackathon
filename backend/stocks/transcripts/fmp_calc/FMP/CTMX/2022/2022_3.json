    "content": " The floor is yours. We selected cathodes in a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor as the payload for this program based on the well-characterized profile of this class and the strong clinical activity observed with TOPO-1-inhibiting ADCs, including, for example, the recent groundbreaking breast cancer data for N HER2. Interferon alpha-2b is an approved immunotherapeutic that has demonstrated clinical activity in multiple cancer types and we believe provides a potentially superior approach to activating antitumor immune responses to IL-2, IL-12 and IL-15. We believe CX-801 has the potential to become a unique centerpiece of combination therapy for a wide range of tumor types, and we aim to rapidly advance this potentially best-in-class program towards clinical evaluation with an IND filing targeted for the second half of 2023. The floor is yours. The floor is yours. The floor is yours. The floor is yours. But due to the mechanism of action of interferon alpha having both anti-direct antitumor effects and also a powerful ability to activate immune cells, we believe this has the potential to be a central component of combination therapies on a go-forward basis, if we can harness its activity by localizing into tumor tissue. We think potentially other mechanisms also shown activity in other solid tumors, certain hematologic tumors, and we think there are plenty of places to go with 801 in the future so looking forward to getting that IND filed again as one of our two wholly-owned new programs on the future horizon."
