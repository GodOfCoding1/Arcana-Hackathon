    "content": "   Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss AutoWeb's Financial Results for the First Quarter ended March 31, 2022. Industry challenges continued to impact our automotive digital marketing segment, which for the first quarter totaled $14.7 million, up from $14.1 million in the last quarter and down from $17.9 million in the year ago quarter. Within the automotive digital marketing segment, our leads revenue in the first quarter totaled $10.6 million, which is down compared to both $10.7 million in the last quarter and $14.2 million in the year ago quarter. The fundamental issue is that it's just a fairly high intensity consumer of cash, which is why we have to suspend operations and furlough those team members so we can focus on the leads and clicks business until we find a positive outcome and then hopefully reestablish operations in vehicle, used vehicle acquisitions."
