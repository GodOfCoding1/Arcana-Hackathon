    "content": " Core bookings came in at over $28 million, an increase of $2.5 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter, with core churn dropping down to 0.7%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the previous quarter, and 20 basis points year-over-year. Total revenue increased by $8.7 million or 4.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, core revenue increased by $9.4 million or 5.9% year-over-year, transaction-adjusted EBITDA in the quarter decreased by $2.3 million or a negative 3.8% year-over-year, but increased by $1.4 million or 3.4% quarter-over-quarter. Although we have established a cost recovery process that successfully pass through over 90% of the increased cost to our customers, there is an approximate 90-day lag for this process, therefore continued increases in utilities costs in the second-half of 2022 cannot be completely recovered in this fiscal year. Going a little deeper into our financials now, turning to slide nine, total revenue for the quarter increased by $8.7 million or 4.9% year-over-year to $184.1 million, while recurring revenue increased by $6.9 million or 4.1% year-over-year, to $174.2 million, driven by strong overall demand."
