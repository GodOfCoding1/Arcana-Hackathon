    "content": " The results of our first quarter when compared to Q1 of fiscal 2022 were 33% higher in revenue, 47% higher in adjusted EBITDA, and 66% higher in net income. Backlog again set a company record at 408.2 million, up 34.4 million or 9.2% over the quarter, and up 190.7 million, or 87.7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Capital spending was 3.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, similar to last year's first quarter. Given the strength of our record backlog along with the manpower and work in process inventory being put into place, we expect revenue and earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to be higher than both the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as the second quarter of last year."
