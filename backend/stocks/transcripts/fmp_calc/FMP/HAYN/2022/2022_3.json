    "content": " Now as far as additional details for the third quarter, as noted revenue was $130.2 million, up 11.2% sequentially and almost 48% year-on-year. The Q3 highlights by market are as follows: Aerospace continues to strengthen as noted previously, we entered $100 million in aerospace orders just this quarter. It's also important to point out that the growth in inventory is simply due to the fact that we have averaged $61 million a month in order entry over the past six months, compared to $41 million per month in shipments over the same time period. Operating income was $20.4 million this quarter, which represents sequential growth of $9.7, compared to the second quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and $19.1 million growth from last year's third quarter. Non-operating retirement benefit income of $1.1 million was favorable to last year's quarterly expense of $1.5 million this is a $6 million improvement, which is expected for the full-year. And I would just add to that I mentioned incremental margins and with volumes continuing to increase and we were GBP4.5 million this quarter, and back to that $5 million quarterly run rate is where we're hoping to get, and that's going to continue to provide incremental strength, continue to provide some contribution margin."
