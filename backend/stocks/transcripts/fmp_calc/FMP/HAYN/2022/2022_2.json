    "content": " Financially, this was an impressive quarter with a 20% gross margin and an 82% sequential increase in net income to $8.5 million. Operating income was $10.7 million this quarter, which represents sequential growth of $5.2 million to the first quarter of fiscal '22 and $14.4 million growth from last year's second quarter, which was an operating loss. Nonoperating retirement benefit income of $1.1 million was favorable to last year's quarterly expense by $1.5 million, a $6 million improvement expected for the full fiscal year. This is estimated to set us up nicely to generate positive operating cash flow beginning next year, then within 2 years potentially having a 0 net liability for the U.S. pension plan, down from $106 million at the beginning of last year."
