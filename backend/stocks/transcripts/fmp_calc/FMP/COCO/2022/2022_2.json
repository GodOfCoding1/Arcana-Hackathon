    "content": " Today, we enjoy undisputed category leadership with 51% value share, which is up 7% from a year ago according to IRI measured tracked channels, MULO-C. We're encouraged by the continued strong growth we're seeing this year and we remain committed to our long-term plan to deepen our household penetration, increase category share and expand usage occasions to drive velocity of our products. We are very happy with our strong first half performance in 2022, which resulted in a first half net sales increase of 19% as compared to the prior year period driven by continued strong consumer demand for our products mainly Vita Coco coconut water. Net sales in the Americas, which comprised 87% of total net sales in the second quarter of 2022 increased 17% to a $100 million compared to $86 million last year. Supporting our volume growth within the Americas, year-to-date, we believe that we've gained approximately 11,000 incremental net points of retail distribution to provided Coco in the United States over the second quarter last year, as more set modifications were rolled out and executed against. On a segment basis, within the America the Vita Coco Coconut Water grew 23% to $76 million of the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year. International segment net sell declines 5% to $15 million in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by foreign exchange headwinds in our European region where on a constant currency basis, net cells increased over the prior year period. Favorable net pricing and positive mix shift to Vita Coco Coconut Water, which were more than upset by significantly higher transportation cost versus last year."
