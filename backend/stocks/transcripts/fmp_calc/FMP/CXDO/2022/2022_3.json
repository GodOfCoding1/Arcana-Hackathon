    "content": " Our Software Solutions revenue increased 2% to $3.9 million compared to $3.8 million and product revenue increased 8% to $760,000 compared to $701,000 for the third quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses for the nine month period increased 37% to $28.9 million compared to $21.1 million for a similar reason, only four months of operating activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Cash used for investing activity for the nine month period of $192,000 for property and equipment purchases compared to $10.5 million used for the same period of the prior year, which included the acquisition of NetSapiens. Our cash used for financing activities for the nine month period was $36,000 compared to cash provided by activities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 investing activities of $1.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Our total cost of acquisition for Allegiant was approximately $9.4 million, which consisted of $2 million in cash, a 1.1 million sellers note and 2.461 million shares of Crexendo stock, which is a very aggressive multiple and why this acquisition is a tremendous win for Crexendo. So as I mentioned on our last quarterly call, the synergies that we are recognizing from both our NetSapiens acquisition regarding personnel and processes has created an even stronger Crexendo, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m extremely confident that the addition of the Allegiant organization will make us much stronger and a much stronger force in the industry. And then just looking at for next year, I think you mentioned that you were looking at doing like a $45 million to $50 million run rate, assuming the acquisition pursue, I assume on that front."
