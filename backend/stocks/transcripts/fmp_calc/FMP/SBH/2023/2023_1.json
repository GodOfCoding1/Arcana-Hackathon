    "content": " Owned brand sales penetration for the Sally segment reached 34% of sales in the first quarter, up from 33% of sales at year-end, and we believe we can grow that to 50% penetration over the next 4 to 5 years, while growing our overall sales low to mid-single digits. First quarter net sales of $957 million declined 2.4%, reflecting the combination of 395 fewer stores and 150 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impact. Let sales declined 2.1%, driven primarily by 210 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and reflects the fact that we had 383 fewer stores in operation versus a year ago. Net sales declined 2.7%, which reflects 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impact and 12 fewer stores versus a year ago. Adjusted gross margin at BSG decreased 130 basis points to 39.8%, primarily driven by product -- lower product margins due to the sales channel mix shift between the segment stores and expanded Regis partnership. We are reiterating our full year expectations as follows: comparable sales, notwithstanding a notable change in consumer behavior are expected to increase by low single digits compared to the prior year, driven by growth in some categories, sales transfer from store closures, our expanded Regis distribution and our new strategic initiatives."
