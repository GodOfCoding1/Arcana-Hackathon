    "content": " In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, comparable sales grew 6.1%, net sales grew 4.7%, gross margin increased to 51% and adjusted EPS was up 26% year-over-year. This quarter, e-commerce sales increased 22% versus a year ago, driven mainly by BSG 's refreshed e-commerce platform and represented 8.3% of total sales in Q1. Looking at gross profit, first quarter gross margin came in at 51%, up 70 basis points to last year, reflecting strength in both the Sally and BSG segments which both delivered increases in product margin that was partially offset by higher distribution and freight costs. And your line is open. And your line is open. And your line is open. If we think about the business and how our comp sales performed in the quarter, we saw particularly strong sales on the BSG side of the business as salons were really fully reopened lapping last year where there was still a fair amount of challenge for a number of stylists in a number of states in operating their businesses. And your line is open. I think the one piece that's a little bit different as we would say, we have stronger gross margin performance in the first quarter with the strength of pricing really coming through and working to offset some of the other costs. So, I think the one piece is a bit more normalized if our gross margin gains throughout the year, we're going to be fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter and versus the four assuming that they were going to be a little bit more back-half weighted. And your line is open. Of one, I think when you first see customers come and shop in the store, if they're a new customer to Sally, we wouldn't really expect them on day one to sign up for a loyalty program. And your line is open. And your line is open."
