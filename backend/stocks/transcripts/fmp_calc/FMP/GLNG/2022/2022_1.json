    "content": " Net income attributable to Golar was $345 million in this quarter, and that includes $168 million noncash gain, which was recognized on our Hilli Brent oil and TTF linked derivative and also a $344 million also noncash market to market gain recognized on our NFE shares based on March 31st position which carry the value of $42.61 per share. With source gas in Africa at around $1 per MMBtu, liquefaction cost on a tolling fee basis similar to what we charge BP on the Gimi of between $2 to $3 per MMBtu and shipping cost of around $1.50, African FLNG projects can today deliver LNG to end users for about $5 per MMBtu. In terms of illustrative economics, a tolling fee based on a large Mark III 5 million pounds FLNG units and a $3 tolling fee, we can generate an EBITDA of such a unit of around $750 million a year versus a CapEx of around 2.5 billion for such a large unit. Integrated projects however, using a 2.5 million ton Mark I design as an example and the landed gas price of $25 per MMBtu, in current gas price environment that would create an annual EBITDA of $2.5 billion to the project owners that we would target to be split between the upstream provider and the FLNG owner."
