    "content": " During the quarter, we have placed orders for long lead items for a new Mark II FLNG with a total liquefaction capacity of 3.5 million tons. We recorded total FLNG tariffs of $109 million, up 81% compared to the Q3 of 2021 on a year-on-year basis. We have also hedged 100% of 2023 and 50% of our 2024 TTF-linked production at levels of around $50 per MMBtu and $51 for 2024, which in total have secured an additional $233 million of distributable adjusted EBITDA to Golar. Add to that the oil upside and the TTF linkage that Eduardo explained, we see commodity linked production adding another $200-plus-million delivery of Gimi will add another $151 million of contracted EBITDA, bringing our adjusted EBITDA at current market rates to well north of $400 million. And then just so I understand this, the $300 million of long lead time items is really specific to the Mark II, where if there was a Mark III design -- I guess you could always go down to the Mark I which would probably require less kit."
