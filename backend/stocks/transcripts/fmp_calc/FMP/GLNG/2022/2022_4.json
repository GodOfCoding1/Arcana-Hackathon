    "content": " It's important to highlight that even after the disposal of our shipping business, we have continued to grow our cash generation due to strong performance from our FLNG business where we almost doubled our EBITDA to $367 million compared to $191 million in 2021. Due to a combination of upstream technical issues in Q4, and Hilli maintenance, 2022, LNG production was 3.5% below the annual contracted volume in a non-cash accrual of $36 million liability was recognized. We expect the dish production shortfall will be compensated through overproduction in 2023, where we expect to recognize an additional EBITDA of $36 million, offsetting the 2022 underutilisation liability with no expected net cash impact to Golar. Our cash position currently stands at more than $1 billion, even when considering the acquisition of NFEs interest in Hilli which will require $100 million cash payments as part of the total consideration and is expected to close in Q1. So on February 6, we agreed to acquire NFEs fee interest in the FLNG Hilli by paying $100 million in cash, plus our remaining 4.1 million NFE shares, and also we assumed $323 million of contracts or debt. The deal brings immediate cash flow to Golar contributing an additional $70 million of EBITDA per year, until the end of the current liquefaction agreement in July 2026. So on the back of our increased shareholding of 94.6% of Hilli common units, the base tolling fees are expected to double in 2023 to around $138 million. Our share of debt service is expected at around $190 million this year, resulting in free cash flow to equity of close to $216 million just from Hilli. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
