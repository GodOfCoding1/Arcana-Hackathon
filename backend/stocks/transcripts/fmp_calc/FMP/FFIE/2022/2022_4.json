On December 15 of last year, we announced that we expect to start production of a FF 91 Futurist at the end of March 2023 subject to timely availability of $150 million to $170 million of additional funding and timely stockholder approval over authorized share increase. On February 5, we announced that we secured $135 million in new financing commitments, pending FF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stockholder vote to increase the authorized shares outstanding and approval of the financing and certain other closing conditions. $55 million is scheduled to be funded within 5 business days of effective registration statement for shares underlining the secured convertible notes and the stockholders approval of the issuance of shares at the upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders, which we just spoke about as well as certain other conditions. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our first product we want to bring into the market this year, but for the development for the 3-year, 5-year this kind of a cycle plan or this kind of mountain plan as a company have also to consider how we apply it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how we apply the platform technology and our mobile advanced AI technology into the FF81, FF71, because we do think FF has a very unique design and we will build very strong brand and with our very strong performance of the car as much as just introduced."
