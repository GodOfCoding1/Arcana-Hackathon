    "content": " In the second half of 2022, we are expecting two pivotal top line results readouts, including top line results from the randomized placebo-controlled 2b/3 study ANAVEX 2-73-AD-004 for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and from the randomized placebo-controlled excellent Phase 2/3 study ANAVEX 2-73-RS-003 for the treatment of pediatric patients with Rett syndrome. Further pipeline expansion of the ANAVEX platform using gene biomarkers of response, applying precision medicine for neurological disorders with unmet medical need is expected in 2022, including meeting with the FDA to discuss the ANAVEX2-73 Parkinson\u2019s disease program including a pivotal Phase 3 study. So I wanted to confirm if you're going to put out the press release on patient enrollment completion and on the primary endpoint, is it reasonable to assume that it's still going to be AUC  And have you talked to the FDA the - I believe the last guidance or last business guidance after the second data readout from the Rett syndrome was that you were going to talk to the FDA. And we probably will very likely use that opportunity to meet also with the FDA to discuss the Parkinson's program in its totality, including the Phase III, which we said we are happy to move forward with given the successful Phase II PDD study. So this will be more likely the early Alzheimer's disease patients, similar to what the Phase II of the ANAVEX 2-73study is right now. We're very excited about the company's potential platform, especially as we build on successful completion of two important biomarker-driven precision medicine pivotal studies, and we're looking forward to this pivotal clinical readouts in Alzheimer disease in pediatric syndrome."
