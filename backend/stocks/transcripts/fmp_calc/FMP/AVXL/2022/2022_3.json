    "content": " Further pipeline expansion of the Anavex platform using gene biomarkers of response applying precision medicine for neurological disorders with unmet medical need is expected in 2022, including meeting with the FDA to discuss the ANAVEX 2-73 Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease program, including a pivotal Phase 3 study, planned initiation of ANAVEX 2-73 imaging-focused Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease clinical study sponsored by the Michael J. The most important takeaway from the genetic analysis of the whole genome of patients getting ANAVEX 2-73 compared to placebo in the Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dementia study was really that the drug shows the ability to resuscitate or to counter down-regulated gene pathways and not only gene pathways but also clusters of gene pathways, which are down-regulated in respective pathology of Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease as well as in the respective pathology of Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease."
