    "content": " As we maintain our attention on execution across each of our clinical programs and overall business operations, we are planning to present top line data of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 study ANAVEX 2-73-AD-004 for the treatment of early Alzheimer disease in a late breaking oral presentation at the upcoming clinical trials on Alzheimer disease, CTAD Congress 2022 on December 1, 2022 at 4:30 PM Pacific Time in San Francisco, California. Recent guidance received from the FDA confirms our strategy to advance ANAVEX 2-73 for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome in our double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 development program. Further pipeline expansion of the Anavex platform using gene biomarkers of response, applying precision medicine for neurological disorders with unmet medical need is expected, including; meeting with the FDA to discuss the ANAVEX 2-73 Parkinson disease program, including a pivotal Phase 3 study; a planned initiation of ANAVEX 2-73 imaging-focused Parkinson disease clinical trial sponsored by the Michael J. This is an exciting time neuroscience and rare disease drug development, and we remain on track for the readout of the placebo-controlled ANAVEX 2-73 Phase 2b/3 Alzheimer disease clinical trial, a condition of significant unmet need and economic burden for which there are only limited approved pharmacological treatment options, as well as initiating biomarker-driven precision medicine clinical studies as planned."
