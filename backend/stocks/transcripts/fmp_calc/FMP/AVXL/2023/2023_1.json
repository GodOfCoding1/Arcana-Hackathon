    "content": " We are pleased by the results of the placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 Alzheimer disease trial, which data suggests that ANAVEX 2-73 blarcamesine, an orally available small molecule activator of the upstream sigma-1 receptor is pivotal to restoring neural cell homeostasis and promoting neuroplasticity and might be at the forefront of biomarker guided pathway based targeted precision medicine drug development. In Parkinson's disease Dementia, we are planning to announce the data from the 48-week open-label extension of the previously successfully completed Phase 2 study. Further, pipeline expansion of the Anavex platform using gene biomarkers of response applying precision medicine of neurological disorders is expected, including planned initiation of an ANAVEX 2-73 imaging-focused Parkinson disease clinical study sponsored by the Michael J. The increase in research and development expenses over the comparable period is primarily related to the expansion of our team and an associated increase in compensation and non-cash charges period-over-period as well as costs associated with our Phase 2b/3 study, ANAVEX 2-73-AD-004, and the manufacture of additional clinical trial supply for upcoming pipeline programs."
