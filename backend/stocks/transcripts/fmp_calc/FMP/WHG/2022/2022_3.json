    "content": " High income was 198 basis points ahead of its blended benchmark, 20% S&P 500 and 80% Bloomberg Barclays aggregate bond index and achieved a 17th percentile ranking among institutional peers in the U.S. Tactical Asset Allocation universe. But despite the headwinds of a lower equity market, our Alternative Income mutual funds finished in the 21st percentile for the quarter and 90th percentile both for year-to-date and trailing one year periods, and Morningstar's Relative Value arbitrage category. Dividend Select which focuses on high quality dividend paying domestic securities is ahead 357 basis points year-to-date and 108 basis points over the trailing period with a dividend yield of 3.2% versus the S&P 500 dividend yield of 2.5%, it's an attractive alternative for high net worth clients seeking income and long-term capital appreciation. Today we reported total revenues of $15.4 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $15.6 million in the second quarter, and $17.9 million in the prior year's third quarter. The third quarter net loss of $1.2 million or $0.15 per share compared unfavorably with last year's third quarter net income of $1.9 million or $0.24 per share, primarily on lower revenues and higher expenses related to our acquisition of Salient Partners Asset Management business."
