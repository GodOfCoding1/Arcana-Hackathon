    "content": " Our income opportunity mutual fund, WHGIX, retained its strong four-star Morningstar rating in the 30% to 50% equity universe with a 17th percentile ranking for the quarter and a 15th percentile ranking for trailing three months ended March 31st. The first quarter net income of $0.1 million or $0.01 per share compared unfavorably with last year's first quarter net income of $4.1 million or $0.52 per share, primarily due to lower performance-based revenues in private investment gains in the prior year's first quarter."
