    "date": "2022-05-08 08:04:04",
    "content": " As a reminder, I would also like to note that due to the appointment in April of new management team members who are focused on completing a 90-day assessment following the closing of a $250 million strategic capital infusion, the company will not be hosting a Q&A session following prepared remarks during today's conference call. The increase in cash burn was primarily due to higher operating losses, partially offset by favorable working capital changes relative to the first quarter of 2021. Financing cash flows during the quarter were $18.1 million, including $25 million of proceeds from a bridge loan and repayment of advances under our revolving line of credit of $6.8 million. The end of first quarter 2022 marked the completion of the company's strategic evaluation process, which culminated in the closing of a $250 million capital infusion from leading life science investors Casdin Capital and Viking Global in April."
