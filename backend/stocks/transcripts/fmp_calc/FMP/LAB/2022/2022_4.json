    "content": " To highlight some key metrics of our financial results, fourth quarter revenue was $26.8 million, representing sequential growth of about 8%, and bringing full year 2022 core revenue to $94.5 million. We have made significant progress on these, which drives our confidence to provide 2023 guidance of flat to moderate core revenue growth, inclusive of the previously disclosed temporary $5 million headwind in our genomics business, significant expansions of our gross margins and lower operating expenses. For the full year 2022, core revenue was $94.5 million compared to $111.6 million in 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, which primarily excludes non-cash charges for stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $133 million versus $118 million in 2021."
