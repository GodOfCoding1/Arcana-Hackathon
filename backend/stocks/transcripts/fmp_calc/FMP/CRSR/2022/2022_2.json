    "content": " Our revenues for the second quarter came in at $284 million, below our expectations entering the quarter, but this does not reflect the purchases of consumers from our retailers, which was significantly higher. The gamer and creator peripheral segment contributed $89 million of net revenue during the second quarter, a decrease of 42.6% from $155.2 million in Q2 2021. The gaming components and systems segment contributed $194.9 million of net revenue during the quarter, a decrease of 38.7% from $317.7 million in Q2 2021. The decrease compared to Q2 2021 was primarily driven by reduced revenues, an incremental $19.5 million inventory reserve charge, increased logistic costs and a return to a more normal promotional activity. The gamer and creator peripheral segment gross profit was $10.6 million, a decrease of 80.7% from $54.6 million in Q2 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in revenue, the inventory reserve charge, increased supply chain and logistics costs, and a return to more normal pre-pandemic level of seasonal promotions. The gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $25.9 million, a decrease of 65.8% from $75.7 million in Q2 2021, primarily driven by the decrease in revenue in the same periods and increased logistics costs. Second quarter SG&A expenses were $73.4 million, a slight decrease of 8.5% compared to $80.2 million in Q2 2021. Adjusted operating loss in the second quarter of 2022 was $14.2 million, a decrease of $63.5 million from operating income of $49.3 million in Q2 2021. Assuming no further debt paydown, we now expect interest expense of approximately $3 million to $4 million per quarter, an effective tax rate of approximately 15% to 20% for 2022, and full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 98 million to 100 million shares."
