    "content": " Our target is to reduce our worldwide channel inventory overhang by roughly $100 million from the start of 2022 to the end of this year, with a little left more to go in our creative and peripheral segment and our European channel inventory. The Gamer and Creator Peripheral segment contributed $96.8 million of net revenue during the third quarter, up from $89 million in the prior quarter and a decrease of 30.5% from $139.3 million in Q3 2021. The Gaming Components & Systems segment contributed $214.9 million of net revenue during the quarter, up from $194.9 million in the prior quarter and a decrease of 14.7% from $251.9 million in Q3 2021. The Gamer and Creator Peripheral segment gross profit was $31.8 million, a decrease of 34.6% from $48.6 million in Q3 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in revenue and the supply chain and logistics costs I just mentioned. The gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $39.8 million, a decrease of 24.7% from $52.8 million in Q3 2021 and primarily driven by the decrease in revenue in the same period and higher logistics costs. The third quarter SG&A expenses were $66.9 million, a 12% decrease compared to $76.1 million in Q3 2021. Adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2022 was $5.9 million, a decrease of $20.5 million from operating income of $26.4 million in Q3 2021."
