    "content": " Company-wide revenues were $1.863 billion in the second quarter of 2022, up 18% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis and up 20% on an as-adjusted basis. Net income per share in the second quarter was $1.60, increasing 20% compared to $1.33 in the second quarter one year ago. On an as-adjusted basis, second quarter talent solutions revenues were up 24% year-over-year. Non-U.S. talent solutions revenues were $295 million, up 20% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. Currency exchange rate movements during the second quarter had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year total revenues by $37 million, $26 million for talent solutions and $11 million for Protiviti. Contract talent solutions bill rates for the quarter increased 8.2% compared to one year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by functional specialization, currency and country. On an as-adjusted basis, global second quarter Protiviti revenues were up 11% versus the year ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 8%. Company-wide second quarter public sector revenue was $94 million, of which $70 million was reported by Protiviti and the balance reported by talent solutions. We expect third quarter 2022 public sector revenues to be $90 to $100 million, and we continue to expect full year 2022 public sector revenues to be flat to up 10% for the year. In contract talent solutions, second quarter gross margin was 39.9% of applicable revenues, compared to 39.7% of applicable revenues in the second quarter one year ago. Our permanent placement talent solutions revenues in the second quarter were 14.7% of consolidated talent solutions revenues, versus 12.8% of consolidated talent solutions revenues in the same quarter one year ago. When combined with contract talent solutions gross margin, overall talent solutions gross margin was 48.7%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared to the year ago second quarter. Adjusted for deferred compensation-related classification impacts, gross margin for Protiviti was 28.1% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.0% one year ago. Enterprise selling, general and administrative costs were 27.3% of global revenues in the second quarter, compared to 30.9% in the same quarter one year ago. Talent solutions SG&A costs were 32.2% of talent solutions revenues for the second quarter, versus 38.4% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted for deferred compensation-related classification impacts, talent solutions SG&A costs were 36.2% for the quarter just ended, compared to 36.3% one year ago. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 14.0% of Protiviti revenues, compared to 12.5% of revenues in the year ago period. Second quarter segment income from our talent solutions divisions was $171 million, with a segment margin of 12.5%. Segment income for Protiviti in the second quarter was $70 million, with a segment margin of 14.1%. With that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1.87 billion to $1.95 billion; income per share, $1.60 to $1.70; midpoint revenues of $1.910 billion are 14% higher than the same period in 2021 on an as-adjusted basis. The major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these assumptions are as follows: revenue growth on a year-over-year basis; talent solutions up 16% to 19%; Protiviti up 6% to 9%; overall up 12% to 16%; gross margin percentage, contract talent, 38% to 40%; Protiviti, 28% to 30%; overall, 42% to 44%. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation classification impacts: talent solutions, 36% to 37%; Protiviti, 14% to 16%; overall, 30% to 32%. Our permanent placement and contract talent solutions segments, including blending solutions with Protiviti have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 180% and 63%, respectively, during the eight quarters since the pandemic trough."
