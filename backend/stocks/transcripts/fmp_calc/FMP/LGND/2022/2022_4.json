    "content": " Profitability in 2022 of $2.44 in adjusted diluted EPS from our core continuing operations, compared to $2.35 in adjusted diluted EPS in 2021, including sales of Captisol for COVID, the adjusted diluted EPS of $4.79 in 2022. Excluding COVID related Captisol sales, our adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 2022 was $0.75, compared with $0.62 in Q4 of 2021. Core Captisol sales were $16.4 million in 2022 versus $23.4 million last year, with the difference due to priority given to COVID-19 shipments as well as the timing of customer orders. Excluding COVID related Captisol sales, our adjusted diluted EPS for 2022 was $2.44 compared with $2.35 in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, including 6.7 million shares of Viking Therapeutics stock at December 31, 2022 Ligand had cash and investments totaling $212 million, and approximately $77 million in outstanding convertible debt which we intend to repay in cash when it matures in May of this year. We expect Captisol material sales in 2023 to be about $21 million and contract revenue to be $25 million, with a large contribution recently earned with the approval of Travere's Sparsentan. However, if investors evaluate the performance of the core business, excluding OmniAb from both periods and excluding the transitory COVID-19-related Captisol material sales, you'll see that the current core Ligand business grew nicely over2021, driven by particularly strong growth on the royalty line. It is an important drug for treating multiple myeloma and reported over $1.3 billion in global sales in 2022 with over $30 million of royalties to Ligand, KYPROLIS is our largest royalty contributor in 2022, and we forecast the same to be true for 2023. In Q3 of 2022, Rylaze reached $73.5 million in sales, and we look forward to Jazz's Q4 commercial report later this quarter."
