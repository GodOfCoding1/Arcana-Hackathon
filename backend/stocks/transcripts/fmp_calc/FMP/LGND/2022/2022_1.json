    "content": "  We will use non-GAAP financial measures and some of our statements will be forward-looking, including those related to our financial condition, results of operations, financial guidance, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected timing, completion and effects of our previously announced plans to spin off the OmniAb business to become a standalone public company pursuant to a business combination with Avista Public Acquisition Corp II. On this basis, we expect that Ligand will generate solid revenue growth and performance this year on revenues between $90 million and $100 million, along with good cash flow as Matt Korenberg will discuss. Total Captisol sales were $12.1 million for the quarter, and this compares with $31.3 million a year ago. And of that $40 million to $50 million of expected Captisol sales, we expect approximately $17 million to $19 million to be core Captisol sales, and the rest, the remainder, to be Captisol sales for COVID. Within all these numbers provided above, we expect $35 million to $45 million of this to be attributable to the OmniAb business, principally in the contract revenue line. We're also introducing full year 2022 earnings guidance and a breakout of revenue and earnings guidance for the Ligand business, excluding OmniAb and excluding COVID related Captisol. We expect revenue for Ligand, excluding OmniAb and COVID related Captisol, to be $90 million to $100 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be $1.50 to $1.80. Anticipating the spinoff of OmniAb and knowing COVID related Captisol sales are likely to decrease significantly and eventually go away completely, we believe this is the best way to track the performance of the remaining Ligand business."
