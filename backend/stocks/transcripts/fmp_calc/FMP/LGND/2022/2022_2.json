    "content": " Strategically, Ligand RemainCo is focused on 3 primary areas: one, acquiring royalty rights to late-stage assets, consistent with what we've done the last 5 to 10 years; two, continuing to strike partnerships for our Captisol and Pelican technologies; and three, refocusing our capital markets activity and messaging for Ligand RemainCo following the OmniAb spin-out. Total Captisol sales were $29.5 million for the quarter, and this compares with $62.5 million a year ago. Core Captisol sales were $3.3 million this quarter, in line with our expectations and on track to meet our expectations for the year. This is lower than last year's second quarter of $13.6 million, but as investors know, contract revenue fluctuation is mostly due to timing of partner events and related milestone payments. Within the revenue numbers I just provided, we expect $35 million to $45 million to be attributable to the OmniAb business principally in the contract revenue line. For that portion of the business, we now expect revenue to be $97 million to $104 million, up from $90 million to $100 million previously; and adjusted diluted EPS to be $1.80 to $2.05, up from $1.50 to $1.80 previously."
