    "content": " For the continuing business, excluding COVID-related Captisol, we now expect revenue to be $99 million to $104 million, up from $97 million to $104 million previously, and adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.05 to $2.20, up from $1.80 to $2.05 previously. And I think it's fair to say that at the time of the bonds being repaid, we'll have at least $50 million of cash on the balance sheet, but we'll have a clean balance sheet from a debt perspective at that standpoint and the ability to use equity. Obviously, last quarter, Q2 was $73 million, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we'll see where the quarter hits this year -- this quarter in Q3."
