    "content": " The $53.8 million net use of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments for the first nine months of 2022 resulted from spending related to net operating activities for the period, including clinical and earlier stage research and development programs, and preparation for the company's anticipated commercial launch. Revenue was $31,000 for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 and was $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Research and development expenses were $17.3 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $15.4 million of third quarter of 2021 and were $48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. General and administrative expenses were $6.2 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2021 and were $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.
