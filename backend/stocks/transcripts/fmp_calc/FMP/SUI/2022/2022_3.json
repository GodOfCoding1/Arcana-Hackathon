    "content": " Manufactured housing, Same Property NOI increased 4.9% for the quarter compared to last year, supported by 4.3% gains in monthly base rent per site, increased occupancy and our ability to manage expenses. On a Same Property basis, annual RV revenues increased 13.4% and total NOI grew 8.4% compared to the third quarter last year. Looking ahead to 2023, we are positioned for continued organic growth in manufactured housing and RV as we expect to realize average rental rate increases of 6.3% for manufactured housing and 7.8% for annual RV at the midpoint, both represent material increases on a year-over-year basis. For the quarter, Same Property manufactured housing and RV NOI increased 6.4%, driven by a 4.7% increase in monthly base rents per site and a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. For the third quarter, Sun reported core FFO per diluted share on a constant currency basis of $2.71, a 28% increase above prior year results and exceeding the high end of our quarterly guidance range. In terms of capital markets activity during the quarter, we repaid $318 million of debt secured by 35 properties, increasing our unencumbered assets to total asset ratio to nearly 79%. At the same property level, we are moderating our full year Manufactured Housing and RV NOI growth expectations by 40 basis points, primarily reflecting revised transient RV revenue expectations for the fourth quarter. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir."
