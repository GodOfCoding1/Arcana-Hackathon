    "content": " We're capturing video, voice, messaging, ideas, the broad spectrum of feedback that our customers need, a much, much richer data pool, and we've got a much more sophisticated operational system for the distribution of lifetime feedback that the others don't have. When you look at our net retention rate, it is a backward-looking metric and it has been impacted by a couple of things: one, it's been impacted by the concession; two, although our overall gross retention rate has increased slightly over the last 12 months, the customers that were in these impacted industries did not expand at the same levels that they had historically prior to the pandemic year. There's also a channel dimension for the mid-market that we're just getting started on with some new reseller capability that we'll probably talk about in more detail in coming days and weeks, where we have some great global footprints that have come over to us from the survey software world to really want to get into this omnichannel digital transformation that we deliver through our platform, our hub-and-spoke model platform and signal, as we call it. Well, that's a great question. I would think that given the ratable nature of SaaS revenue, the $2 million upside in Q1 would also benefit the quarters thereafter, but it doesn't seem like that based on the full year guide. And if you look at that from the back half of the year, not only do you see an acceleration in the Q1 guide that we've given you over -- sorry, the Q2 guide that we've given you over Q1, you'll also see that there's acceleration in the gross subscription growth rate in Q3 and Q4 over the first half of the year. Well, that's a great question."
