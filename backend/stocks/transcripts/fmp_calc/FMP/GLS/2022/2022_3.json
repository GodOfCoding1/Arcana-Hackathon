    "content": " Despite a significant reduction in marketing spend, we acquired over 23,500 new members and sold over 92,000 units during the third quarter of 2022, more than twice as many units as we sold in the prior year quarter. Product revenue during the third quarter of 2022 was $6.4 million driven by over 92,000 units sold, which is more than double the units sold in the same quarter in the prior year. With the increase in sales volume, this resulted in gross profit of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $9.6 million year-to-date compared to $251,000 in the third quarter of 2021 and $709,000 for the nine months then ended. While we reduced investments in selling and marketing during the third quarter of 2022 to preserve liquidity, we saw continued demand for Plenity created by the broad consumer awareness marketing activities during the first half of this year. Thank you, Dan, for the question. Thank you, Dan, for the question."
