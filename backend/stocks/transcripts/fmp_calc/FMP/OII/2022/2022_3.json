    "content": " Now I'll focus my comments on our performance for the third quarter of 2022, our current market outlook, Oceaneering's consolidated and business segment outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022 and our initial consolidated 2023 outlook, including the previously mentioned EBITDA guidance range and free cash flow expectations. Operating income and related margin percentage of $4.3 million and 5%, respectively, improved measurably from the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to increased manufacturing throughput in our subsea hardware businesses. Offshore Projects Group, or OPG, third quarter 2022 operating income increased as compared to the second quarter of 2022 on a 31% increase in revenue. Broadly, for the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to the third quarter, we expect slightly lower activity in our energy segments, lower operating profitability in our ADTech segment and increased unallocated expenses. So in summary, based on our year-to-date financial performance and expectations for the fourth quarter of 2022, we are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $215 million to $240 million for the full year."
