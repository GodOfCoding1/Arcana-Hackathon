In Q4, U.S revenue grew 27% on a reported basis and represented 89% of our total revenue in the quarter and 90% for full year 2022. International revenue grew 57% year-over-year and represented 11% of quarterly revenue, up from 9% in Q4 last year. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $27 million to $29 million, representing 4% to 12% year-over-year growth and as reported basis. And to your last question, absolutely 100% what you're seeing on the top line is a factor of macroeconomics, because if you look at the old core KPIs, retention of key core clients, and the amount of core clients, we close more logos in Q4, and in Q1, we retained a lot of them."
