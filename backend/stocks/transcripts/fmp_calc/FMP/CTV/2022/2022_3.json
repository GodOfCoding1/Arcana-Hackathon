    "content": " And the reason I'm saying this is an unfair advantage, because the chances that either even the largest measurement provider, the legacy one, or some of these, kind of early challengers that you mentioned, will have a very hard time to almost no chance to build the CTV, like an ad serving CTV infrastructure, like we've been building for 15 years and winning share from Google, that combination, we believe is very, very powerful. If you remember, TVSquared came from, which is a great benefit to us mid-market, their classical legacy clients will be more performance TV advertisers like, Peloton or GoDaddy, which is a great place to be, because I think you asked us in the previous calls, like, kind of the future of CTV in terms of you're going to see more and more new entrants that are smaller, that are more going to be driving towards performance. We're going to discuss our vision, but we're also going to bring a live product demo on stage, so show you the actual product in action, which is always exciting and we're going to unpack the CTV, how we see it kind of back to Laura's questions and we're going to talk more about how we see the future of CTV across this very exciting and complex landscape."
