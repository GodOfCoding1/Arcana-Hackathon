    "content": " We're not moving as fast as we'd like, and I don't think we have the support from the ad market that we expected, but we are getting things done that we expected to get done, which is most significantly migrating Dotdash -- migrate Meredith in the Dotdash platform, that we've done in days. I think if you rewind a year ago, when we started the rebrands, and you said we'd get the Ads and Leads business back to growth. So as we've lapped the Roofing acquisition, I think it's important to, say, unpack a couple of things so we can put the overall growth rate together. So in terms of the Ads and Leads business where, obviously, a bunch of stuff going on in terms of lapping the rebrand, we've got the Angi brand continuing to be -- continuing to grow pretty aggressively, outperforming, I think, the expectations that we had. As that fixes itself and we fix the Roofing business, it will take us a couple of quarters to do it probably, we expect to get back into -- ultimately get back into the 15% to 20% range at some point in the next year. And if you take a basket of Byrdie, Investopedia, Brides and Liquor.com, which is a good cross-section of the different types of sites that we have and we'll migrate here, if you look at traffic growth or audience growth, let's just keep it a simple traffic growth to keep the math easy, in 4 months, we typically see on average, and they're all bumpy so you blend it up, call it, 10% to 15% growth."
