    "content": " Although this earnings call is to discuss results from the high season that just wrapped up, we're also highly encouraged by the book of business building for the next high season in 2023 as the year-over-year revenue in ADR pacing remained robust, driven by our MICE business pacing at two times, the pre -pandemic levels for the year ahead. And that's what we're seeing, that's why we're driving high-margins, and that's why I think we're going to get more and more people coming to our resorts, particularly in the summer season."
