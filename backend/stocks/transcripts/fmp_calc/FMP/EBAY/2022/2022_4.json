    "content": " Although macro headwinds remain more pronounced in Europe, our focused category strategy continued to drive underlying growth internationally, including positive year-over-year growth in P&A and notable strength in luxury categories during Q4. Your line is open. So if you think about focused categories outgrowing the rest of the business by seven points, the double-digit change that we've seen in customer satisfaction, we took on our largest focus category at the end of last year with parts and accessories, and we're seeing that return to market share growth, which is great. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The 2% increase in year-over-year non-GAAP expense growth includes the 120 basis points of margin headwinds that we talked about associated with M&A and the eBay International Shipping program, and it's net of $100 million of the structural cost program that we've laid out. Your line is open. Your line is open."
