    "content": " Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 included recognition of the $60 million approval milestone from Provention Bio related to Teplizumab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval in the fourth quarter, 30 million milestone payments from insight related to retifanlimab. Finally, in terms of our cash runway, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance of $154.3 million as of December 31, 2022 plus projected and anticipated future payments from partners, product revenues, and $100 million proceeds from the DRI   should extend our cash runway through 2025. Now, with regard to combining going forward, that's why we're doing the study right now is to see if new side effects occur, if you look at the actual side effect profile of the individual molecules, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little overlap in terms of the type of side effects that we're seeing by treatment of patients individually, but we'll have to see as we go forward with regard to how we envision optimizing the dosing, well, quite often because the mechanisms by which these drugs work are quite different."
