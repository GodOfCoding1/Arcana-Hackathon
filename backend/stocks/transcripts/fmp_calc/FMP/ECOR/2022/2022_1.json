    "content": " Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 hit a record $1.9 million, increasing approximately 58% over the first quarter of 2021 and approximately 27% sequentially. Net revenue from the U.S. commercial headache channel was $277,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, a 90% increase from $145,000 in the first quarter of 2021. Revenue from channels outside the United States decreased 20% to $305,000 in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $380,000 for the first quarter of 2021. Thank you, Dan For the first quarter ended March 31, 2022, electroCore reported net sales of $1.9 million as compared to $1.2 million during the same period of 2021. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, was approximately $4.8 million as compared to $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. I see many potential growth drivers through 2022 and 2023, including continued penetration of our VA DoD channel in the United States, continued penetration of the United Kingdom market as the pandemic recedes, growth in our U.S. commercial channel driven by cash pay business models and direct-to-consumer advertising, while we continue our efforts to gain commercial insurance coverage, and fourth, expansion of our international business through our distributor network and added traction within the UK e-commerce store.

It\u2019s also \u2013 I think, Brian, what you said earlier is duration of therapy, which is another way of saying refill prescriptions because our fundamental model is the longer you use the device, the better your clinical results are going to be, and we basically we generally get paid on a recurring revenue model.
