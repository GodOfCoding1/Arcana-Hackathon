Revenue from the US commercial channel was $1.7 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022, a 158% increase from $679,000 in the full year 2021. $1.6 million of our US commercial revenue in 2022 came from cash pay programs as compared to $310,000 for 2021. Net sales from the government channel, including Department of Veterans Affairs or the VA, the Department of Defense or DoD, and other government departments were $5.2 million, an increase of 60% as compared to $3.3 million in the full year 2022, a total of 117 VA and DoD military treatment facilities have purchased gammaCore products through December 31, 2022 as compared to 100 through the fourth quarter of 2021. Thank you, Dan, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, electricCore reported net sales of $2.6 million, representing 72% growth compared to $1.5 million in the same period of 2021. For the full year 2022, the company reported net sales of $8.6 million, representing 58% growth as compared to net sales $5.5 million for the full year 2021. Research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.6 million as compared to $742,000 for the same period in 2021. Selling, general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $6.2 million as compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2021. Net cash used in operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 was $4 million as compared to $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2022 totaled $18 million as compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect net cash usage in the first quarter 2023 to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely due to seasonal factors affecting working capital, increased investment in product evolution. I see many potential growth drivers in 2023 and beyond, including continued penetration of our VA DoD channel in the United States, growth in our US commercial channel, driven by cash pay business models, further development of the Truvaga product for wellness, anxiety and sleep, driven by an increased spend directed to consumer advertising efforts, further development of the TAC-STIM brand for human performance in the active duty military and beyond by leveraging the BOOST program financed by the Air Force and our app enabled new product platform that'll facilitate consumer facing digital health solutions and unlock new business models. The first half of \u00e2\u0080\u009822 was impacted by COVID, and I'm very excited about sort of on the one hand that back to normal access that we will have for the full year 2023 multiplied by just the increased number of feet on the street we have, because we're recruiting 10.99 reps. And so growing that business 60% in 2022 over 2021, we ought to be able to grow at least 50% and probably more like 60% or 70% in 2023 over 2022."
