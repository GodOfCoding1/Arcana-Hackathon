    "content": " For Annamycin, we not only completed the Phase 1 portion of our STS lung mets trial in the U.S., but we also kicked off two additional Phase 1/2 trials, one in STS lung mets using an alternate dosing regimen and one combining Annamycin with Cytarabine in relapsed or refractory AML. Beyond Annamycin, our antimetabolite portfolio really came into its own this year with the startup and completion of a Phase 1 trial of WP1122 in healthy volunteers where we set an MTD or maximum tolerated dose to be utilized in possible future trials. In fact, its ability to concentrate in the lungs at 30 times the level of doxorubicin in preclinical studies is what led to the successful conclusion of a Phase 1b study of Annamycin in patients with soft tissue sarcoma lung mets. Also, both European trials, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one in STS and one in AML, should show Phase 1 progress this year that we expect will lead to Phase 2 activity and data next year."
