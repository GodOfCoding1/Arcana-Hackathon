    "content": " For 2022, we delivered record net sales, gross profit, gross margin, adjusted EFO and adjusted diluted EPS, and we ended the year with positive cash flow from operations of $98 million. And then I wanted to talk about the fourth quarter, where you had basically your revenue down, your gross profit was up, roughly $21 million, and you're operating -- and basically, your SG&A was flat quarter-to-quarter, which seems surprising. Joyce, you mentioned you're obviously finishing a very strong year in 2022, and I think, gross profit dollars grew 13% during 2022 after a very, very strong year. When you look at the growth that we're seeing in 2023, it is less devices in that growth number, which helps us overall -- from a overall gross margin perspective, and gives us the confidence with regard to what's happening with infrastructure, our backlog around infrastructure, in particular, as well as the performance that we have shown in cloud, software and Insight core services that leads to that gross margin expansion number."
