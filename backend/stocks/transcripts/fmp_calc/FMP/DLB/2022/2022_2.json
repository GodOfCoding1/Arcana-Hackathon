    "content": " Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and our imaging patents, which represented almost 25% of our licensing revenue last year benefit from these same valuable characteristics, but with greater opportunity for growth ahead as they are earlier in their adoption cycles. On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue was about $15 million higher than last year's Q2, as we benefited from the strength in PC and CE along with improved results for Dolby Cinema and our cinema products business. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 CE licensing increased by approximately $5.7 million or 12% driven by higher foundational audio revenues for DMAs and sound bars as well as higher recoveries. They were down $1.8 million year-over-year, as lower foundational revenues from gaming and automotive due to the ongoing supply chain constraints were partially offset by higher revenues in Dolby Cinema. That being said, we still anticipate total licensing growth in fiscal 2022 will be driven by Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and imaging patents across all end markets with year-over-year growth in excess of 35%. Broadcast revenue is now estimated to decrease mid-single digits as growth from Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and imaging patents is more than offset by decreases in foundational revenue, particularly in TVs due to lower shipments that I mentioned earlier."
