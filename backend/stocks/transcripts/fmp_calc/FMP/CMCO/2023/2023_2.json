    "content": " On a constant currency basis, revenue of $232 million was up 8.5% year-over-year, driven by strong pricing power and the contribution of Garvey, our conveying solutions bolt-on acquisition. Our strategic move to acquire Dorner enabled us to acquire Garvey in December of last year, and this quarter, Garvey contributed $9 million in revenue at 50% gross margin rates. On slide seven, net sales in the second quarter were $231.7 million, up 8.5% from the prior year period on a constant currency basis and within the guidance we provided last quarter. More specifically, trailing first quarter orders were elevated ahead of price increases in June by approximately $10 million, and although, we are still seeing healthy quote rates on projects, customers were slow to release orders toward the latter half of the quarter given delays they are experiencing with the execution of these projects."
