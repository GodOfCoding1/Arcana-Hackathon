    "content": " Slide 7, net sales in the third quarter were $230.4 million, up 10.5% from the prior year period on a constant currency basis, and above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. Turning to Slide 10, operating income in the quarter increased 32% to $20.2 million and adjusted operating income was $23.5 million. Our backlog remained stable at $329 million in the quarter, and was more current given the 28% reduction in past due orders we achieved in the period. And what I was mentioning is that a large driver of why we didn't see our historical 100 basis point drop that we would typically see because of less workdays is that we had -- we own Garvey for 1 month, but they had a tremendous month of December with some meaningful revenue to one large customer that had almost 60% gross margin. However, we are going to see roughly an 80 basis point mix, negative mix impact from some rail projects that are going to ship in the quarter and our rail business has typically -- it's about a $10 million of revenue. Hey -- so, Jon, that was really what we talked about with Steve, a few minutes ago, where normally we'd expect roughly the 37% gross margins roughly in the fourth quarter, and they'd be expanded from our current levels, or we're going to have this negative mix impact from a rail business that we think is roughly about an 80 basis point negative impact."
