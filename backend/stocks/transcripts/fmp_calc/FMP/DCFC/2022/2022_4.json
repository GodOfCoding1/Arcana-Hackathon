    "content": " Although the six-week delay commensurately pushes six weeks of planned builds and the associated $45 million of revenue into the first quarter of calendar year 2023, to date, we have not lost any of those purchase orders and we expect to continue to fulfil our auto backlog as production capacity increases and order fulfilment accelerates through the rest of this calendar year. Your line is open. I think though, in terms of the delay, there was, as we mentioned the component shortages, which had an impact on the end of line test equipment and the staff onboarding that didn't meet schedule, but we don't believe the $45 million of revenue that's going to shift to quarter three of financial year '23 means that any of that revenue's lost because we don't need to make room for the shifted revenue. Your line is open. In terms of where we are seeing the demand and what we might be seeing from NEVI and the Inflation Reduction Act changes is that interestingly, we had a look at our top five customers buy revenue for fiscal year '22, and there's a really good mix of segments. Your line is open. Then we do have the margin benefits of the capacity increase that's enabled by the Tennessee factory as the volumes increase, and we produce and sell more, that has this significant benefit to the bottom line and improves gross margins and what we do find particularly promising is we just don't think we're going to have the same kind of input price pressure escalation in 2023. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. In terms of wrapping up, I think what I would like to say is for the company overall, we're very, we think it's very important to say that today's release, we're very pleased to have come in within 1% of planned revenue for the half that we've just reported and 3% for the full fiscal year."
