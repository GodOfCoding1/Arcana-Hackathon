Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, we don't feel there's any risk on that we're accruing right now for any units that ship we are keeping track of how many units we built and how many units we've shipped on the assumption that we will get, get our production tax credit for those units and that we will have direct pay available to us because the law has been pretty clear on that. Your line is now open. And then the last question for me before I jump back in queue, if you look at the rate of cash burn here, obviously spent some, you've been building some stuff, and it sounds like that's slowing down that you burn about $100 million since the December quarter of last year, that's probably not sustainable, given what it sounds like I'm hearing about this year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
