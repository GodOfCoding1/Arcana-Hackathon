    "content": " For the fourth quarter ended December 25th, 2022, we reported GAAP net income of $12.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $13.8 million or $0.40 per diluted share last year. Franchise income for the quarter was $5.8 million, up 6.1% versus the same period last year, driven by comparable franchisee sales growth of 2.3%. Food and beverage costs improved versus the prior year quarter by 93 basis points to 33.2%, as beef prices declined approximately 4%, partially offset by a 1% increase in the balance of our commodity basket. To give you a sense of the impact of beef prices on our overall financial performance, we estimate that a 10% change in beef costs would impact EBITDA by approximately $6 million to $7 million on an annual basis, all else remaining equal. Labor expense for the quarter was versus 2021 increased 200 basis points, primarily due to hourly wage increases of approximately 9.5% and increased management labor due to higher wages as well as more managers per restaurant versus the same time last year. So on the investment overall in the 10% that we're talking about is a combination of both what we call major remodels, which will be between $1.5 million and $2 million as well as more minor remodels, which include carpet and shares, and we will be testing the new exterior on a few of those as well this year. You're correct, we roll off the first quarter this year, we lose that 40 basis points you discussed and for the full year, we expect pricing based on this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only this one pricing increase, which again, we'll look again in about midyear into September for another opportunity to take price hitting out of the dynamics of the cost an inflation environment."
