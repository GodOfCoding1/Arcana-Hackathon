So I think, as we were in the fourth quarter, it was a bit higher as a percent of sales, we saw Q1 as Omicron started to slow down, and we were seeing the restaurants become busy again, we're looking at between 3% and 5% of sales still very valuable. I think we saw a little during the holidays,  is fourth quarter, but again, that was kind of overshadowed by the beginnings of Omicron and so I think now we are seeing a combination of the work, especially on the holidays, and those really high peak, high capacity days, the combination of the demand from the guests and being able to meet that demand through the capacity utilization platform that's in place."
