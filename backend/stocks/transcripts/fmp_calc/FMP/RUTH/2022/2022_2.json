    "content": " For the period, we were also able to effectively manage costs, resulting in strong year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth of 20% and 41% versus the same quarter in 2019. With this new platform, we experienced comp sales growth of between 25% and 30% versus 2019 and on all three of our major holidays during the quarter, Easter, Mother's Day and Father's Day. Franchise income for the quarter was $5.1 million, up 13.3% versus the same period last year, driven by comparable franchisee sales growth of 12.3%. Overall, restaurant margin as a percent of sales declined approximately 65 basis points versus 2021, primarily due to higher labor and other operating expenses, offset by lower food and beverage costs. As we move to the back half of the year, we expect beef deflation similar to this quarter and mid-single-digit inflation on the rest of the basket resulting in relatively flat year-over-year food and beverage costs versus 2021. Moving beyond restaurant expenses, combined marketing and G&A as a percent of revenues was 10.9%, compared to 10.8% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the timing of expenses related to the implementation of our new data platform and the addition of certain key resources into the business."
