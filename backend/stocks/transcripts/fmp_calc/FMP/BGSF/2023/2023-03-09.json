    "content": " I am very pleased to report record revenues in 2022 of 298 million, a strong 24.8% increase over 2021 and full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were at 45% and 47% respectively, over the prior year period. The increase was driven by $4 million of annualized headcount costs for new roles, primarily in the second half of the year associated with strategic investments for internal talent to support known projects and fuel future growth plans. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was 1.4 million or $0.14 per diluted share compared with net income of 4.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share a year ago, which included a net cares credit of 1.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share. SG&A a cost as a percentage of sales grew 60 basis points this year, compared with last year, a detail of our '22 versus '21 SG&A and a cost is included in the MD&A section of our annual report on form 10-K. Net income from continuing operations was 11.3 million for $1.07 per diluted share, compared to 10.5 million for $1 per diluted share for the '21 period."
