    "content": " As Beth discussed, strong momentum continued into the third quarter with revenue up 22.3% to $78.5 million compared to $21 million by segment, real estate grew 34.1% and professional increased 14.9%. Gross profit increased by a strong 27% compared to the prior year quarter, growing to $28 million, primarily due to revenue expansion and increased spread in both segments. Your line is now open. So interesting enough, Normally, in the third quarter, it's tough to maintain that because that's normally their highest volume and they tend to have a little bit of pressure on pay to keep our people working, but did a much better job of managing that this year, and we're able to pass through that cost to the customers and help support that spread increase. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
