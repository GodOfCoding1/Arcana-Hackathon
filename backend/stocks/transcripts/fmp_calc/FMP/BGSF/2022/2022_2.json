    "content": " I'll begin today's call with a few operational highlights for the second quarter, then I'll turn the call over Dan to provide more details around our Q2 financial results, followed by an update to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch of our enterprise-wide technology upgrade, and discuss our pipeline, strategic initiatives, and M&A. Moving to our financial highlights from continuing operations, strong momentum continued into the second quarter, with total revenues up 29.1% to $74.1 million, compared to \u00e2\u0080\u009921. Gross profit increased by 30.2% compared to the prior quarter, growing to $25.1 million, primarily due to revenue expansion and increased spread in both segments. As a reminder, last year's Q2 income included a pretax credit of $1.2 million associated with continued consideration recorded from an acquisition in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for Q2 was $5.4 million or 7.3% of revenues, compared to $3.2 million or 5.6% of revenues in \u00e2\u0080\u009821. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of \u00e2\u0080\u009822 totaled $10.3 million or 7.2% of revenue, compared to the prior year of $6.7 million or 6.3% of revenue. At the end of the second quarter, our accounts receivables balance was $50.1 million, up 4% compared to year-end, while days sales outstanding, or DSO, improved by six days from year-end."
