    "content": " Excluding the gains and losses on investments from both periods and including the additional revenues and water supply costs caused from the delay in the water general rate case in our third quarter results, adjusted consolidated diluted earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were $0.82 per share as compared to adjusted diluted earnings of $0.76 per share for the same period in 2021, an adjusted increase of $0.06 per share or nearly 8%. In addition, due to the delay in receiving a final decision on the pending water rate case, while the revenues for 2022 were based on 2021 adopted rate has a new rate being approved and implemented on January 1, 2022 consistent with the November 2021 settlement agreement reached between Golden State Water and the Public Advocates Office, CPUC, we would have reported additional revenue and water supply costs that would have resulted in higher earnings of $0.10 per share for the third quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009822. Excluding the gains and losses on investments from both periods and including the impact caused by the delay in the water GRC in the results, adjusted consolidated earnings for the quarter were $0.82 per share as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.76 per share for Q3 of 2021 that is an increase of $0.06 per share, or near 8%. For our Water segment, earnings were $0.54 per share as compared to $0.62 per share last year, an $0.08 decrease both items as discussed, affected earnings at the Water segment, so factoring the same effect from two items, adjusted earnings for the third quarter at the Water segment, were $0.67 per share, which was an increase of $0.05 per share as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share for the same period in 2021. Also included in the Water segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results for the quarter was a $1.9 million reduction in revenue, or $0.04 per share to express our best estimates of revenue subject to refund from Golden State Water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pending cost of capital applications, which included impact of a lower cost of debt requested in application. Excluding the gains and losses on the retirement plan investment from both periods and including the result of the new water rate from settlement agreement for the first 9 months of 2022, adjusted consolidated earnings for the 9 months were $2.03 per share, which were higher than adjusted earnings of $1.96 per share for the same period in 2021. In addition, had 2022 water rates been approved consistent with the settlement agreement in the general rate case and implemented on January 1, 2022, Golden State Water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings contribution for the third quarter would have been $0.10 per share higher and $0.29 per share higher for the first 9 months of 2022. Finally, we also record a reduction to water revenues, which decreased the quarterly and year-to-date per share earnings by $0.04 and $0.10 respectively to reflect our best estimate at this time based on our accounting assessment of revenues subject to refund from the pending cost of capital proceeding filed in May 2021, which includes the impact of Golden State Water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lower cost of debt requested in its application. In the third quarter, we recorded a reduction to revenues of $1.9 million or $0.04 per share and $5 million or $0.10 per share for the year-to-date 2022 to reflect the estimated revenue impact of a lower cost of debt of 5.1% as requested in our application as compared to 6.6% included in 2021 rates currently being built to our water customers."
