    "content": " Excluding the gains on investments from both periods and including the impacts caused by the delay in the water general rate case in the results, adjusted consolidated earnings for the quarter were $0.56 per share as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.51 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $0.05 per share or nearly 10% despite a $0.03 per share reduction in earnings for Q4 of 2022 as a result of recording a lower debt cost in the pending cost of capital proceeding for the Water segment. Excluding the gains and losses on the retirement plan investments from both periods and including the results of the new water rate settlement agreement for 2022, adjusted consolidated earnings for 2022 were $2.59 per share, which were $0.12 per share higher than adjusted earnings of $2.47 per share for 2021, despite of a $0.13 per share reduction in 2022's earnings as a result of a lower debt cost in the pending cost of capital proceeding. We have recorded a reduction to water revenues, which decreased fourth quarter 2022 earnings by $0.03 per share and the earnings for the full year of 2022 by $0.13 per share to reflect the estimated revenue impact of a lower cost of debt of 5.1% as requested in our cost of capital application as compared to 6.6% included in 2021 rate currently being built to water customers."
