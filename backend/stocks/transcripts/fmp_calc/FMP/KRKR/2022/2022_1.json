    "content": " Turning now to our enterprise value-added services, which grew 35% year-over-year in the first quarter despite COVID-19 impact, thanks to our strategy adjustments and new service formats. Looking on to our subscription services, we continue to test waters with new variations in the subscription services including launch innovations and business for training programs and other forms of institutional interactions supported by our continuous upgrades and premium services cost in a fourth quarter revenue from institutional and corporate clients increased 57% year-over-year. Note fully, our new business initiative, 36Kr enterprise service review platform continues its strong growth trajectory with major metrics improving substantially year-over-year. So we believe as we refine our product and for the commercialization mostly, the enterprise service review platform role includes 36Kr's overall fundamentals will be more significant and it will become the second growth of the company and we want that to become as early as possible and materially change the market perception of 36Kr valuation logic, so maybe in the future quarters, the portion from 36Kr enterprise service review platform revenue will be increased significantly."
