    "content": " 2.0 is focus areas our inventory reduction, where we expect to realize at least $400 million in cash flow benefit this year by limiting production and selling through current inventory, and another $85 million and cost outs to be realized in fiscal '23 and '24. I believe we're being reasonable with this year's sales forecast by assuming will be flat and POS units in the U.S. consumer business with the exception of a 10% hike in units and fertilizer and seed, which were down nearly 20% last year and represent one of our most weather dependent businesses. For Hawthorne sales, we're making the assumption we have reached the industry trough in the fourth quarter anticipate sales at the start of the year to merely run rate we ended with in fiscal '22. Adjustments from operating income to EBITDA are expected to be about $25 million higher in fiscal '23 and fiscal 22, primarily due to increased depreciation and a change to pay short term variable compensation if targets are achieved, mostly in shares rather than cash."
