    "content": " That said, we added 1.5 million new users in 2022, ending the year with nearly 7.9 million total users on the Cricut platform, just shy of our initial expectations at the beginning of the year of 8 million users, boosted in part by strong connected machine sales in Q4 2021 and the first two months of 2022. Breaking revenue down further, revenue from connected machines for the year was $252.6 million, down 54% over 2021, reflecting softer consumer spend and excess channel inventory levels throughout most of the year. Subscriptions revenue for the year was $272.3 million, a 32% increase over 2021 and benefited from targeted investments in Cricut Access and the expansive improvements made over the last several quarters. For the full year, Connected Machine margin was 3.3%, down from 11.7% in 2021, and was primarily impacted by higher fixed costs as a percentage of revenue in warehousing and operations expense, along with increased warranty expense and promotional activity."
