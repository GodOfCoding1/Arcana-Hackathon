    "content": " At the end of Q1 2022, we had nearly 7 million users on our platform, a growth of more than 4 million users from 2 years ago with 54% of total users engaged over the last 90 days. In the first quarter, we delivered revenue of $244.8 million, a decline of 24% compared to prior year Q1, which benefited from a strong pandemic-related year-over-year growth rate of 125%. Revenue from subscriptions was $64.8 million, up 40% over last year, and nearly 238% on a 2-year basis, driven by seasonally high machine sales in Q4 and prior investments made to increase the value in Cricut Access. Revenue from Accessories and Materials was $117.6 million, down 14% over last year, compared to the pre-pandemic Q1 2020 Accessories and Materials revenues grew 74% on a 2-year basis, reflecting growth in our engaged user base. Your line is open. Your line is open. And that gives me confidence that as we go into while we will see a continued slow growth in users for the next couple of quarters, we believe that as we head into Q4, the same kind of thing that drives Cricut every year, which is holidays and Halloween and Christmas and gift giving and home decoration, will be the growth drivers. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
