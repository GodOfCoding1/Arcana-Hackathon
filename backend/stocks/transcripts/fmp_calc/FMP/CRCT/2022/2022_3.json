    "content": " Net new users added in the quarter were down 26% compared to last year, while connected machine revenue was down 49%, indicating that inventory moved through the channel. Revenue from Accessories and Materials was $55.7 million, down 47% over last year when we benefited from channel fill of Smart Materials related to the launch of next generation cutting machines, continued replenishment orders, and higher engagement trends. And we and we do see increasing competition, that space, but the other is engagement, because it's a proxy for users consuming the materials and, and needing to repurchase and -- at any given quarter, it's hard to quantify the impact the isolate the impact of each one of those factors, but we know each of those come into play. And last, but not the least, which I think is really important, right, which is that we're going to continue to partner and lead and with retailers that are, going to showcase the compatibility of the materials and really be focused on, giving the customer the best experience, because we ultimately think that that will ultimately be good for engagement and the long-term health of the category and really gives the consumer best experience. If you look at sequential growth in net new users historically, it would suggest that you could end the year kind of right around your original 8 million kind of total user target you guide into a few quarters ago, I realized that's not the hard and fast guide today."
