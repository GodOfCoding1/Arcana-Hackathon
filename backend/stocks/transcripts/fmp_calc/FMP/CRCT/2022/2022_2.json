    "content": " Last quarter, I outlined four key areas of investment: Improve user onboarding and drive engagement; focus on increased monetization through our subscription software service; Cricut Access and Accessories and Materials Continued investments in international market leveraging our low-cost word of mouth marketing playbook, and Innovate and expand the platform. Revenue from subscriptions was $67.6 million, up 33% over last year and 4% sequentially, a remarkable accomplishment given the pressure we saw in Connected Machines revenue and a demonstration of the durability of our business model. Revenue from Accessories and Materials was $80.7 million, down 41% over last year and reflected similar pressure from increased channel inventory levels, macro-economic trends, and competition. I just love to know where it is now, because I thought if I interpreted your comment earlier about net new users down 34% that would mean the, kind of, incremental 40% of declines in connected machines was due to channel that would imply like $62-ish-million of headwinds. So we may actually increase the value proposition, but our relative turnover and phase-in, phase-out of machines will actually slowdown, because we think that that's an opportunity we haven't fully availed off to-date, and again, for the last six months, we've been working really hard, which is the result you saw in subscriptions to basically create so much content and so much capability that we think that it would lead on the price lever year-on-year on just kind of basically having to phase-in, phase-out more machine more frequently."
