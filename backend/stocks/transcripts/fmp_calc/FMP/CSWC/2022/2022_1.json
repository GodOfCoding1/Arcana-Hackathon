    "content": " I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has increased our total dividends per share to $0.54 for the coming quarter ending September 30, 2021 consisting of a regular dividend increase from $0.43 per share to $0.44 per share and a quarterly supplemental dividend of $0.10 per share. Investment income was $1.4 million higher this quarter, due primarily to an increase in average credit investments outstanding, as well as an increase in cash dividends paid from our equity portfolio. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. No, it's a pretty -- I mean I'd say if you looked at the list of investments, it's probably almost -- maybe 40% of them had appreciation and -- just thinking of the list I don't have the list in front of me, probably 20% of them had some kind of depreciation with the appreciation being higher than that small -- the 20% of the companies that were depreciated and a bunch of them that were basically flat. Your line is open. And then, if we think about repayments, looking down our portfolio names and the dialogue we're having with the companies, add up kind of the names -- the capital that we would put a pin on saying, okay, that's something that very likely would prepay before the end of the calendar year and that number is about $50 million. So quite frankly, the way we're looking at it is with our originations and our cost of debt and cost of operating leverage coming down, if and when the rates start rising for the first 75 basis points, you'll see our growth on NII slow, but you -- essentially once you get past that 75% then you're going to see an acceleration. Your line is open."
