    "content": " In addition, given the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate increases and the resulting excess earnings being generated by our floating debt portfolio, our Board of Directors has also declared a supplemental dividend of $0.05 per share for the December quarter, bringing total dividends declared for the December quarter to $0.57 per share. Additionally, over the same time period, we have paid or declared 18 special or supplemental dividends totaling $3.61 per share generated from excess earnings and realized gains from our investment portfolio. We believe our track record of consistently growing our dividend, the solid performance of our portfolio as well as our company's sustained access to capital markets has demonstrated the strength of our investment and capitalization management strategies as well as the absolute alignment of our -- all our decisions with the interest of our shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, our equity co-investment portfolio consisted of 46 investments with a total fair value of $102.6 million, which included $38.6 million in embedded unrealized or approximately $1.34 per share. Our equity portfolio, which represented approximately 10% of our total portfolio at fair value as of the end of the quarter, continues to provide our shareholders participation in the attractive upside potential of these growing lower middle market businesses, which will come in the form of NAV per share growth and supplemental dividends paid over time. As illustrated on Slide 10, our on-balance sheet credit portfolio as of the end of the quarter, excluding our I-45 senior loan fund, grew 4% to $930 million as compared to $865 million as of the end of the prior quarter. Additionally, we committed $18 million in first lien senior secured debt of 5 existing portfolio companies and $816,000 in equity co-investments to 2 existing portfolio companies. Since the launch of our credit strategy, we have realized 16 portfolio -- 66 portfolio exits, representing $716 million in proceeds -- $763 million of proceeds that have generated a cumulative weighted average IRR of 14.7%. As of the end of the quarter, the total portfolio at fair value was weighted approximately 85% first lien senior secured debt, 5% of second lien senior secured debt and 10% to equity co-investments. Based upon the interest rate environment and the continued strong performance of our equity portfolio, we expect to continue to distribute quarterly supplemental dividends for the foreseeable future. For the quarter, our investment portfolio generated total investment income of $26.8 million, producing a weighted average yield on all investments of 10.3%. The primary driver of the NAV per share decrease for the quarter was $8.4 million of unrealized on the on-balance sheet debt portfolio, partially offset by $4.2 million of net appreciation on the equity portfolio. In summary, we have a credit portfolio heavily weighted to first lien senior secured debt allocated across a broader array of companies and industries, 90% of which is backed by private equity firms. We basically take the company's performance and compare it to the current base rate, interest coverage and then we take that model and we sensitize it by increasing the base rates to simulate the increases and see when we start getting a number of companies kind of in the red zone on just a pure static fixed charge coverage ratio calculation, which -- and I would tell you that when that base rate gets to 5.5%, there's a handful of companies that are definitely in the red zone. But if you look at 97% of our portfolios, I mean, granted that -- those are financials that are a month old, right, a month or 2 old, because that's the way the valuations in the quarters end, but we feel like it's hanging in there pretty well."
