    "content": " Regarding FDA's third RMAT criteria related to preliminary clinical evidence, we have long known that the clinical data we generated while SkinTE marketed as a 361 HCT/P had value not only to the patients whose lives were improved, but also to our understanding of how the product worked in different wound types. While our SkinTE development program remains focused on chronic cutaneous ulcers such as the Wagner Grade 2 DFUs in our first pivotal study under IND, The RMAT submission also allowed us to show FDA all the clinical data that has been published to-date."
