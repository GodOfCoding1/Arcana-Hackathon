    "content": " We achieved all-time high quarterly net sales of $4.68 billion, which combined with an enhanced gross profit margin of 31.9% and continued strong operational leverage resulted in record quarterly earnings per share of $9.15 cents as well as significant cash flow to fuel our growth and stockholder return priorities. Given the elevated pricing levels at the beginning of the second quarter that moderated for many products in the latter part of the quarter, our average selling price was a record $3,240 per ton sold. As Jim noted, record sales supported by healthy demand and elevated pricing levels contributed to record quarterly gross profit dollars in the second quarter of 2022 and a strong gross profit margin of 31.9%. Consistent with our accounting policy, we allocate our annual LIFO estimate on a pro rata basis each reporting period, which resulted in LIFO expense of $12.5 million in the second quarter, the true up to our new annual estimate through June 30, 2022. Our second quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased $35.5 million or 5.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to higher than anticipated inflationary pressures for fuel, freight and packaging costs along with higher incentive based compensation associated with a 9.4% increase in pretax profits. On a year-over-year basis our second quarter same-store non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased $63.2 million or 11.2% mainly due to the same inflationary factors, including higher wages, as well as incentive-based compensation due to significantly higher levels of gross profit and pretax income."
