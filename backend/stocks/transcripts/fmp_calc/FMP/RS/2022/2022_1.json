    "content": "  Though we experienced some gross profit margin compression compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to inventory costs approaching replacement costs for certain of our products, key elements of our model, such as small order size, quick turnaround, a broad range of value-added capabilities and careful expense management enabled us to improve bottom line profitability and led to a record quarterly earnings per share of $8.33 for the first quarter of 2022 as well as record first quarter cash flow from operations of $404 million."
