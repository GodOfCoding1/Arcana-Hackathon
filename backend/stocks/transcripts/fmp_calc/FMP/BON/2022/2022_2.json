    "content": " The new construction is expected to increase our production capacity of fragrance compounds and bioactive food ingredients by 200%, representing a 150% annualized growth potential in revenue. The selling price of fragrance compounds, powder drinks and bioactive food ingredients increased by 64.1%, 11.2% and 79.2% as we raise our selling price in response to the rising raw material costs and market change as affected by the COVID-19 and the shortage of the principal raw material due to abnormal weather. The sales volume of bioactive food ingredients also increased by 47.5%, although the selling price was raised from about 33,000 kilograms to about 49,000 kilograms due to strong customer demand and our sales efforts to promote sales of milk thistle extract, with benefit to protect liver and lower blood sugar. In addition, the sales volume of health supplements decreased by 37.5% to 130,000 cases, mainly due to the shortage of our raw material, which suffered a normal wet weather in the second half of 2021, along with disruption of logistics caused by COVID-19. At the same time, our gross profit for the first half of 2022 was approximately \u00c2\u00a34 million, increased by 19.6%, which was mainly driven by strong  growth from fragrance compounds and bioactive food ingredients. Despite the global supply chain challenges in 2021, revenue generated from domestic China was $13.1 million, achieving a 22.4% increase in sales, which represents approximately 95.7% of our total revenue for the first half of 2022."
