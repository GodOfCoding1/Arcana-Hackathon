    "content": " In the December quarter, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gross margin increased by 8.9 percentage point from same period last year, reaching a record high of 40%. According to our estimates, total foot traffic to offline MINISO stores decreased by 32% year-over-year in this quarter, while average ticket size increased by 6%, thanks to our brand upgrade efforts, partially offsetting the decrease in traffic. Overseas revenue reached nearly RMB 1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 38%, a quarter-on-quarter increase of 7% and increase of nearly 5% over the same period in 2019. Revenue in the December quarter was about RMB 2.5 billion, a decrease of 10% year-on-year primarily due to a 27% year-over-year decline in our revenue in China, partially offset by a 38% increase in revenue in overseas markets. So based on our estimation, so total foot traffic to our off-line stores decreased by about 27%, 36% and 34% in each of October, November and December, while average spending per ticket size increased by about 5%, 7% and 7%, which translate into a decline of 23%, 32% and 30% in sales in these corresponding periods."
