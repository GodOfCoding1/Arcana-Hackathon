    "content": " Despite the shelter-in-place during this quarter, domestic operations of MINISO brand recorded a revenue of CNY1.87 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by a 16% year-over-year increase in average store count and a 58% year-over-year increase in our e-commerce business. Revenue generated from international operations was CNY623 million, up 78% year-over-year and 80% quarter-over-quarter, thanks to the improved sales recovery in important markets such as Mexico and the restocking by distributors for the upcoming holiday season. With its rapid expansion this quarter, TOP TOY's revenue increased by 64% sequentially and exceeded CNY100 million for the first time. Revenue in September quarter was CNY2.654 billion, increased by 28% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter, above the high end of the company's guidance range of up CNY2.45 billion to CNY2.65 billion. Revenue generated from domestic operations of MINISO brand was CNY1.87 billion, increased by 13% year-over-year, mainly driven by a year-over-year increase of 16% in average store count and year-over-year growth of 58% in our e-commerce business. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributed to increased personnel-related expense, logistics expense and marketing expense as with the year-over-year revenue growth and the brand awareness improvement for both MINISO and TOP TOY, and to a lesser extent, increased license expense as with the increased revenue contribution from IP products. But we do believe that with the development of TOP TOY's scale and it's the mature of its proprietary products, TOP TOY's merchandise gross margin will improve as we have showed earlier that -- at the -- early of 2021, TOP TOY's merchandise gross margin was about less than 40%, but its merchandise margin has reached about 5% by the end of September and at the beginning of October."
