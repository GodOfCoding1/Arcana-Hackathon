    "content": " According to our estimates, nationwide footprints to our MINISO stores decreased by about 2%, a 14% and 34% on a year-over-year basis from January to March, respectively, due to the strict control measures by local governments. In March quarter in China, revenue of MINISO brand was RMB1.69 billion, on which off-line stores recorded revenue of RMB1.56 billion, up slightly year-over-year. From a year-over-year perspective, our revenue increased by 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by 17% year-over-year growth in overseas market, but dragged by 2% year-over-year growth in China, which was caused by the linger effect of the Omicron vibrant. As we have mentioned in CEO's prepared remarks in China in this quarter, revenue from off-line business of MINISO brand grew by 1% year-over-year. Our TOP TOY brand, although it recorded a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 300%, its operation was also negatively impacted by the Omicron, with more than 10% of the stores were temporarily closed in March. From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, revenue from overseas market down 28%, as you may know that our overseas business is subject to seasonality, typically, with the strongest performance in the same quarter and lost in March quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to one, revenue contribution of overseas market increased by about 2% from about 20% in the same period of 2021 to 22% in this quarter. In China, our business suffered more in April than in March with average 380 MINISO stores were temporarily closed and total revenue down about 10% sequentially. If we look at the first - the March quarter's year-over-year growth rose 30% or so, entered into the June quarter, we have seen apparently acceleration in the whole recovery in overseas markets."
