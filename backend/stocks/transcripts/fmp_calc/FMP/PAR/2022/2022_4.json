Total revenues were $97.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 19.7% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, with growth coming from both restaurant retail and government segments. Our total recurring revenue base, which includes both subscription services and hardware support contracts within professional services continues to expand with $34.9 million reported in Q4 2022, an increase of 34.2% compared to the $26 million in Q4 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We don't want to buy something that's sort of really cool technology that we can't distribute through our sales force because that efficiency, as you can see, I think it's one of the things we haven't talked about a lot, but I think it's most impressive is we haven't really grown our SG&A expense outside of acquisitions in a couple of years, yet we continue to grow the business side of the business meaningfully. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
