It's expected by us that those new logos will be much smaller in size when we compare it to some of the migration activities that we're doing, but we expect those new logos to start small and grow rapidly over time as we take all of the business insight that we have from looking and working with the biggest companies in the world with the most complex use cases and making those kind of solutions available to customers that are just starting out with us in the cloud. Your line is now open. Thank you so much. Your line is now open. And so, if it's -- what we wanted to do from a cloud lake launch perspective at the end of Q3 was, to your very point, make the market aware that not only can they access the very best enterprise data warehouse utilizing Teradata VantageCloud technology, they can also have the very best data lake solution, utilizing VantageCloud technology. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Your line is now open. And I mentioned it a little bit earlier in the Q&A session and also in my prepared remarks, if you look at where this -- what this company has done in the last 2.5 years, it's increased its cloud ARR six-fold to over $350 million of cloud ARR. Your line is now open. Thank you so much."
