    "content": " In the second quarter, we delivered public cloud ARR of $234 million, growing 75% year-over-year in constant currency. In the second quarter, we reported $25 million of sequential cloud ARR growth or $30 million in constant currency. This is below our planned rate, but we are still on track to deliver our outlook of approximately 80% growth year-over-year in cloud ARR as reported and in constant currency. Both were driven primarily by customers shifting their Teradata spend to term or cloud subscriptions and were also impacted by currency headwinds and the ceasing of Russia operations, which was in last year's numbers. You remain confident in the demand and pipeline around cloud, but perhaps there was some delay in on-prem renewals, and I wanted to touch on that if I look at the on-prem ARR, I come up with about 6% decline in constant currency, which was down versus a 3% decline last quarter, or maybe flat in Q4."
