So, it would look like to me when stimulus checks hit last year, second quarter boomed, we probably pulled forward within the year some sales, but again, if you look at the full-year 2021, units were not far off what I'll call historical trend. I think the other thing I would point out is if you take kind of step back and just look at the competitive analysis, and look at all the players in the industry and how they're performing and what their competitive position is, it looks like to me we're in a stronger competitive position at the end of the second quarter than we were this time last year, whether it be some companies, it's a little more difficult to raise capital.
