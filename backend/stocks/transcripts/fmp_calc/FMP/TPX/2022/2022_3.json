    "content": " And then what I would close with is, again, supporting our brands is advertising a bit down on a year-over-year, but consistent with the third quarter, we want to make sure that we're supporting those brands, especially Stearns & Foster in period of a launch. And if you seasonalize that, I mean, you're going to show up with, call it, this quarter's earnings capacity, it's something like $2.90, $2.95 on an annual basis, which gives us, I guess, a good bit of confidence. And then finally, I'll close down with a couple of things as commodities, we've experienced unprecedented commodity inflation over the last little bit, let's call it, 400 basis points of pressure and the power of our brands and from an industry standpoint is we've been able to offset dollar for dollar, the commodity inflation that we've seen through pricing. So -- and I think during this period, a multiyear period, a lot of the retailers closed some stores over the last few years and got more rational from a store perspective and it certainly become much better retailers as we have to, from an online standpoint and pushed back some of the new entries, and we're seeing our historical retailers, traditional retailers become much more agile in Internet marketing and sales and become much stronger entities. And again, it's early, and we don't have all the information, but my perception and early data, I think, would show maybe during the second and third quarter, our market share accelerated as far as taking share from the bed-and-the-box guys and the online guys and the new players."
