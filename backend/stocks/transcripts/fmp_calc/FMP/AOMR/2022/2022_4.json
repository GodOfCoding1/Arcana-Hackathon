    "content": " Second, in December and early January, we converted approximately $286 million of mark-to-market debt from non-mark-to-market financing for continually performing loans, further reducing financing risk. The loans sold carried an unrealized loss of approximately $44 million as of the end of Q3, all of which were realized upon the sale in addition to the $19 million incremental loss. $1 billion of residential mortgage loans and securitization trust, and $1.1 billion of RMBS, including $62 million and retained AOMT securities from the pre-IPO securitizations. This difference is driven by our participation in January's AOMT 2023-1 securitization, which released approximately $190 million of mark-to-market warehouse debt. Economic book value, which fair values all non-recourse securitization obligations was $13.11 per share as of December 31, 2022, up 1.3% from $12.94 per share as of September 30, 2022. I'd expect with that securitization that the net interest margin should stay slightly compressed due to higher borrowing costs, but as we've moved another $240 million off to fixed securitization costs. So unrestricted cash today is about $30 million but that is -- and then we also have about another $60 million of unlevered assets, bonds that are easily convertible and then about $18 million of unlevered loans that we could either lever or sell pretty easily."
