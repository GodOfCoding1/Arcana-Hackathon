    "content": " From our IPO through the end of the quarter, we have purchased over $2 billion of high quality non-premium loans, including $676 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our target assets, which include our residential and commercial whole loans and securities and loans in securitization trust, were $2.7 billion, a 20% increase over the prior quarter. Additionally, we added $50 million to our committed available financing capacity in the first quarter, plus an additional $340 million in April of 2022 bringing our total capacity to $1.64 billion as of today. And to your last point, around mixing these loans that's absolutely how we look at these things so we are continuing to buy current coupon loans, I mean from Angel Oak or even from outside sellers mixing them with the local partner to create somewhat of a higher coupon pool and execute securitizations over the next six to 12 months to make the securitization process easier for us."
