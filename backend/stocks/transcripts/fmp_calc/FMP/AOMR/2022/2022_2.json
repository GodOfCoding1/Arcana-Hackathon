    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, Angel Oak Mortgage REIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demonstrated resilience against the continued volatile environment that saw further increases in interest rates and widespread dislocation across fixed income and securitization markets. The securitization deal freed up additional cash, reduced loan financing facilities by over $150 million and helped to clear out lower coupon loans to be replaced with loans over 7% and weighted average coupons. We have a total of $1.3 billion in residential home loans, $983 million of residential mortgages and securitization trust, and $923 million of RMBs, including $74.7 million in retained AOMT securities from the pre-IPO securitizations."
