    "content": " First, I want to speak to the guidance we provided during the call last quarter, which included approximately $5 million of expenses associated with a pre-separation commitment to Xperi Inc. At the time, we were still in the process of determining the proper accounting for those costs. I look at it as more as a point in time, but as we progress in our business throughout the years, we signed new deals and new license agreements and that momentum, you will start to see us reporting a shift in   to that baseline revenue when we see some movement that we deem to be somewhat significant from a reporting standpoint."
