    "content": " Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA AI enterprise software. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. With our new business model, customers can engage NVIDIA's full scale of AI computing across their private to any public cloud. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster. And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models. First of all, as you know, our Data Center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of 8 Hoppers or 8 Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x."
