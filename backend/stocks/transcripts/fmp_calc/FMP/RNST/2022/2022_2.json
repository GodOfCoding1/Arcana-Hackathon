    "content": " Loan growth was strong again in the second quarter, with total loans increasing $290 million from Q1 both production and advances on existing lines increased quarter-over-quarter, driving net loan growth in nearly all categories. And Kevin, I would just add to Kevin's comments, if you just think about the $877 million in production we saw this quarter, about 35% of that was driven by relationship managers that has joined the company in the last 3 years. Of course, flip side of that, we're seeing good production out of our current team, but it's really -- as we grow the company, as we are very focused on expense and our expense base, which you can see evident of what's been taken out of the company to Kevin's point, of the last number of quarters."
