    "content": " We recently announced that we completed our acquisition of Republic Business Credit or RBC on December 30 2022, which added $77.5 million in loans on the date of acquisition consistent with our acquisition of southeastern commercial finance earlier in 2022, this transaction advances our strategies of building more scale and reach in some of our specialty lines of businesses. In our legacy business, another quarter of strong loan growth coupled with the Fed rate increases drove an increase in interest income of nearly $22 million on linked quarter basis. But I'll direct you first to page 19 just kind of give you a high level overview of the build quarter-over-quarter and you can see it kind of breaks down into from a from a legacy Renasant standpoint, charge-offs $2.6 billion -- $2.6 million provision legacy at $7.9 million. And as I mentioned earlier, just the granularity of our ability to produce and our consumer, which is more one to four family that represented about 26% of that $700 million small business credits, which continues to be a strength in our markets, and that's loans that would be less than $2.5 million in size represented another 10%."
