    "content": " I would -- not to put words in your mouth, but I would assume we're not going to see this kind of expansion linked quarter going forward, but maybe diminishing and anything you can give us in terms of next few quarters and maybe where the margin and yield and cost of deposits stood for the month of September, any of that would be helpful. So, Brad, I will start with production and pipeline and talk a bit about both geographically and products, our business lines where we're seeing that production and growth and then maybe make a comment about payoffs, which all -- both production and payoffs moderated this quarter. And what's encouraging is -- and as I look back over the last number of quarters, is just where we see that production coming from, and it really comes back to talent and markets, our business line, where we do business, breaking that $753 million, down 15% of that was Tennessee. That's loans less than $2.5 million, then your more generalist-type commercial loans, C&I, owner occupied, some commercial real estate loans generally over $2.5 million, 31% and then in our corporate banking group, our commercial business lines, things like ABL, equipment finance, senior housing was 29%. But I think you've seen what we've been talking about, and that's that operating leverage, where expenses are up, they're up 1% to 2%, 3%, but net interest income is up 15% to 17%."
