    "content": " We achieved our target of approximately $74 million in total saving, $40 million from direct marketing, which was realized over the second half of 2022 and overhead reductions representing $36 million of annualized run rate savings. As we disclosed in the middle of 2022, and as Amber touched on earlier, we have been actively working to reduce expenses and executed on a cost reduction initiative throughout the second half of the year targeting $74 million in total expense savings. As a result, and through the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $30 million of annualized overhead reduction as compared to the run rate in first quarter 2022. Second, we targeted an approximately $37 million reduction to direct marketing expenditures in the second half of the year, as compared to the first half of 2022. Sales and marketing costs were $50.4 million this quarter compared to $65.7 million in the year ago quarter, a decrease of $15.3 million. Adjusted CFFO was $18.4 million in fourth quarter 2022, compared to $5 million in the year ago quarter, with the increase primarily due to moving 2022 annual bonus payments into the first quarter of 2023."
