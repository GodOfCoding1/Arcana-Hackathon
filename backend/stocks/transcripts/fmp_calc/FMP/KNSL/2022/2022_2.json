    "content": " This quarter's performance is similar to our experience over the last couple of years, where we have been able to raise rates to our customers above loss cost trend and at the same time, grow our premium volume at a remarkable level. Again, just another really strong quarter from an operating income perspective with a 43% increase in gross written premiums and a 51% increase in operating earnings for all the reasons that Mike just mentioned, including higher rates and our superior business model. I think that's the one message I was trying to kind of communicate is, given our business model, focused on not just E&S but smaller accounts within the E&S market, hey, it's still can be quite competitive but I think there's a little bit of a break from the intensity of the competition in a soft market environment."
