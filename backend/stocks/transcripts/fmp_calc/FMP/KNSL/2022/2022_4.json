    "content": " Most of the improvement in the quarterly expense ratio, so the 19.9% this quarter compared to 21.4% last year, related to ceding commissions from the company's casualty and commercial property proportional reinsurance agreements. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. One of the extraordinary things about Kinsale's business model is, we're able to operate with an expense ratio that's really dramatically lower than the general marketplace, which gives us a lot of flexibility to offer more value to the business owner in the form of more competitively priced insurance, but at the same time, deliver best-in-class returns to our stockholders. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I think Kinsale's put an enormous amount of effort in not just the last year, but going back years in developing people and developing human capital, and I think it's paying-off and allowing us to grow the business and not have lack of personnel be a constraint on growth."
