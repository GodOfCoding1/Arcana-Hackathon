    "content": " Beyond Hurricane Ian, the quarter was a continuation of the trends we have experienced over the last several years, a relatively hard market with a strong growth in submissions, strong top line growth in premium, and favorable profit margins on our underwriting. I think Ian losses were negative surprise this quarter, or at least versus my number, but you put up a pretty strong  loss ratio at about 67%, so year-over-year roughly consistent but then sequentially that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty significant improvement. I just think an example would be a new business would start out in the non-standard market many times, a couple years later if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had favorable loss history, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably go the standard side, so that back and forth goes on all the time."
