    "content": " From July 1st of 2021 through March 31st of 2022, we realized $30.2 million of additional GAAP income from these shares as compared to the $1,093.9 million we recognize in the second quarter of last year. Our liquidity decreased by $133.1 million from year end, which includes the $87.6 million decline related to the sale of NASDAQ shares, $30.9 million for repurchases of 1.7 million shares of Newmark stock and normal first quarter changes in working capital. This year through yesterday's close, we repurchased 7.4 million shares of Newmark for $110.4 million at an average price of $15.01 per share. There's still a tremendous amount of capital available for SFR, BTR and multifamily but on a going forward basis because the returns have been so significant over the past few years, I do believe that even if they fall off due to an increase in rates or risk there's still quite a bit of return built into these business models and that it's not going to necessarily impact flow."
