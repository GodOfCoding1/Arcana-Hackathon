    "content": " With over $410 billion of global institutional real estate capital waiting to be deployed and $2.5 trillion of commercial and multifamily debt maturing over the next five years, we expect industry volumes to bounce back relatively quickly once US interest rates are no longer rising and have stabilized. Please proceed with your question. And so that -- all that continues and we see with $400 billion of capital to invest in commercial real estate, $2.5 trillion of debt maturities coming up over the next few years, while there may be a temporary pause or decline in activity once, as Barry said, there's some stabilization in interest rates and some understanding of where pricing is, we think the activity will start to pick back up. Please proceed with your question. First Barry, maybe just continuing on the leasing front with office, what are you guys seeing as far as leasing trends, meaning there's some chatter that certain functions like back office, like accounting or IT, even the top tier professional services or companies or having those people work from home. In some respects, if the spreads really widen and interest rates remain really high, there's some -- some people might say that over the long term year run, that could be a really good thing because a lot of the is created through cap rate compression. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
