    "content": " As we've consolidated our Audio Division, delivered record revenues of $64 million and a record adjusted EBITDA of $15 million. I can proudly tell you now, those combined businesses will do well over $85 million and over $18 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 105% compared to adjusted EBITDA of last year. On a U.S. GAAP basis, LiveOne posted a consolidated net loss of $3.2 million or $0.04 per diluted share in Q3 fiscal '23 and a net loss of $5.3 million or $0.06 for the 9 months ended December 31, 2022. Our Audio Division's adjusted EBITDA for the 3- and 9-month periods was also a record of $5.1 million and $15 million, respectively. And as you know, we did well north of $15 million in year's EBITDA when the last one we did. So of that $21 million converted, right, you're going to have about $96 million shares outstanding. And while we made all these cuts and cut 30% of our staff, we are adding in B2B because we're seeing unique opportunities to really grow the business with partners who have 10 million to 2.5 billion eyeballs. And on the pay-per-view side, it's really interesting because we haven't really pressed the envelope on this year as we've spent most of the time, right, consolidating, right, taking EBITDA up dramatically, that pay-per-view business has $1 billion of upside. Yes, it's a little -- it's going to be less than that because remember, we sold $8 million at a $68 million valuation."
