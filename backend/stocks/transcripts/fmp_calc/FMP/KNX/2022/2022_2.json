    "content": " These new and expanded services along with warehousing and equipment leasing have nearly quadrupled revenue and is on pace to generate $500 million of revenue this year with projected operating income of over $40 million, compared to a loss of $68 million in 2019. Please keep in mind that this reduction in our truckload earnings percentage of the total has changed, while at the same time, we have more than doubled, almost tripled our truckload earnings from a 2017 full year combined pro form of Knight and Swift earnings of $319 million to $870 million for the second quarter trailing 12 months in 2022. And so what you've seen happen now for several quarters consecutively and again here powerfully in the second quarter is, we've been able to bring third party carriers in to move these loads that are more -- that's more efficient for the carrier, it's more efficient for the supply chain, we're able to manage that whole transaction."
