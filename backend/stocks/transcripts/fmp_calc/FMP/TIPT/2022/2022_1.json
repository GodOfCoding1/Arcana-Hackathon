    "content": " Based on the transaction multiple of trailing 12 months adjusted net income, which is implicit in Warburg\u2019s investment, Tiptree\u2019s retained ownership on Fortegra, on an as converted basis, represents approximately 739 million, or $20 per diluted Tiptree share, 140 million of proceeds will go to tip the Tiptree Holding Company to fully repay outstanding debt, with the remaining to be deployed as gross capital within Fortegra. This is a business -- mortgages have been around for all of our lifetime for well -- for many generations, they\u2019re going to continue to be around for a long time, as long as we\u2019re returning and having a return on equity, consistent with what we view as equity objectives, when allocating our shareholder capital, which would be, in my opinion, in the high teens to 20s on a net basis."
