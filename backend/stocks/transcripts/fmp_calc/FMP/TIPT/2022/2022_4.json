    "content": " For the quarter, net income was $0.9 million driven primarily by the gain on sale of two product tankers and improved performance in our insurance business, offset by declines in mortgage volumes and deferred tax expense related to the Warburg transaction. In summary, 2022 was a record year for Fortegra, with premiums of $2.7 billion, adjusted net income of $84 million and adjusted return on average equity of 26%. Based on the transaction multiple of trailing 12 months, adjusted net income, implicit in Warburg's investment, Tiptree's retained ownership of Fortegra on an as-converted basis represents approximately $779 million, or $20.45 for diluted Tiptree share."
