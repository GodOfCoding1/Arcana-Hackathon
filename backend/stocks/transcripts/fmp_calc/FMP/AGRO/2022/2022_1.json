    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, both hydrous and anhydrous ethanol traded at an average price of 19.1 and 20.108 per pound sugar equivalent, marking a 3.2% and 12.5% premium to sugar respectively. We were able to capture the increasing prices thanks to our beginning of period inventories, which were 56% higher than in the First Quarter of 2021 in the case of ethanol, and 75% in the case of sugar. As you can see on the right chart, net ethanol sales for the quarter amounted to $57 million, marking a 31.1% increase year-over-year on higher average setting prices, mainly led by anhydrous ethanol. Lastly, net sales of sugar during the quarter declined 69.1% year-over-year to net $8 million. Adjusted EBITDA in the farming and land transformation businesses amounted to $36 million for the first quarter, 36.6% below the same period of last year. Whereas, our adjusted EBITDA amounted to $86 million, marking a 20.8% decline compared to the same period of last year. So that's why there is increasing prices that you can see of 100% or even more than 100% is the last two years in fertilizers or some of the  inputs like herbicides and in our particular case because of using really small amount on producing in our systems is that we have an overall increase and including the herbicides, fertilizers, and the sale of around 20% from '21 to '22 campaign."
