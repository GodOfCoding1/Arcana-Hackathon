    "content": " Sugarcane yields during the last quarter of 2022 were 24% higher compared to the same period of last year, reaching 81 tons per hectare and TRS content presented a 12% improvement, amounting for 134 kg per ton. Looking at the full year picture, sugarcane yields gradually improved throughout the year, going from 44 tons per hectare in the first quarter until reaching solid levels in the fourth quarter as we expected, whereas TRS content reached 131 kg per ton, making a 2% increase year-over-year. During the quarter, on average, anhydrous ethanol in Mato Grosso do Sul traded at $0.196 per pound, 2% premium to sugar, whereas hydrous ethanol traded at $0.179 per pound, 7% discount to sugar. On a full year basis, anhydrous ethanol sales were 66% higher compared to 2021 on higher volumes sold abroad at more attractive selling prices than in the domestic market. Net sales amounted to $198 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, making a 26% increase compared to the same period of last year. Total cash costs on a per unit basis in 2022 increased by 25% compared to the previous year, reaching $0.131 per pound of sugar equivalent. Moreover, there was: first, a 12% year-over-year increase in maintenance CapEx, driven by higher renewal area of our sugarcane plantation in addition to an increase in cost of inputs for such planting renewal; second, a 24% year-over-year reduction in energy cogeneration as we use our bagasse to dehydrate our hydro stocks; and third, a 14% year-over-year reduction in tax recovery due to lower ethanol sales into the domestic market."
