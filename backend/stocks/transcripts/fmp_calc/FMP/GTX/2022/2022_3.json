    "content": " I am pleased to report that third quarter 2022 net sales grew 13% to $945 million on a GAAP basis, but on a constant currency basis, sales grew 25% over the prior year. Strong operating performance in Q3 drove adjusted EBITDA of $146 million, up 9% over last year and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.4% versus 16%. Looking at the right-hand side of the page, you can see the improvement in adjusted EBITDA to $146 million in 3Q 2022 as compared with $138 million in Q2 and $134 million last year. Lastly, on the bottom left graph, you can see that Garrett generated positive adjusted free cash flow of $120 million, driven by increased earnings and a positive impact from the change in working capital. Gasoline products now comprise 43% of reported net sales, up from 39% last year, driven by volume growth as well as new program launches, driven by share of demand gains from our 50% new business win rate since 2018. Diesel grew 21% at constant currency, adding $48 million to sales versus the prior year and now comprises 25% of total sales versus 27% last year. 3Q 2022 volumes of 3.6 million units represented 15% growth over the prior year and 12% growth over Q2 of 2022, driving improved adjusted EBITDA by $38 million, compared to the prior year. We delivered net sales of $945 million, up 13% on a GAAP basis and up 25% from a constant currency basis from last year."
