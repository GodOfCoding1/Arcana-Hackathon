    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA of $146 million and the resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% are also down from Q1, 2021, due to the factors mentioned above, but trended upward from Q4 last year, as pricing pass-through initiatives and additional productivity offset inflation and increased supply chain cost. Turning to the right-hand side of the page, while adjusted EBITDA of $146 million in Q1 of 2022 decreased 17% from Q1 of 2021, it was up on a sequential basis by 13% from Q4 of 2021. Lastly, in Q1, 2022, adjusted free cash flow was $38 million, driven by lower volume and continued CapEx investments, which were higher due to carryover from 2021, which is typical in the first quarter. So, in summary, Q1, 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $146 million led to a 16.2% adjusted EBITDA margin as we successfully offset inflationary pressures and a higher R&D spend through productivity, pass-through efforts, despite lower volumes and foreign exchange headwinds. Deducting the change in working capital, cash taxes, capital expenditures, including carryover spend from 2021 projects, cash interest, which includes factoring and P-notes and $11 million of Series B accretion related to the early retirement of 197 million of Series B shares and the $20 million in employee bonus incentives related to 2021, all resulted in adjusted free cash of $38 million for Q1 of 2022. When you compare the prior adjusted EBITDA guidance, the macro factors of lower supply chain related production drives a $40 million reduction in FX, mainly a weaker Euro now seen at US$1.08 to the Euro for the full year versus the prior assumption of US$1.13, results in a reduction of $28 million."
