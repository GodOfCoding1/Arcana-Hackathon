    "content": " Over the past year and a half, we have generated revenues in excess of $50 million based on our proprietary GENFLEX platform at Enzo Clinical Lab, enabling our Company as a formidable provider of testing for our region. We also added 70 new customers at Enzo Clinical Labs this quarter, an increase of nearly 50% from 47 new customers in the previous year\u2019s first quarter with accounts ranging from urgent care facilities to government entities such as Suffolk County. Total revenue reached $26.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 7% sequentially compared to $24.8 million in the fourth quarter last year, but a decrease of $2.1 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. On a divisional basis, clinical services revenue for the first quarter was $19.7 million, an increase of 17% sequentially compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter last year, but a decrease of $1.5 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Product revenue for the first quarter was $6.8 million, a decrease of 9% from $7.4 million in the year ago period due to the temporary delay from transitioning from Ann Arbor, Michigan facility to the upgraded Farmingdale, New York campus, as well as ongoing COVID-19-related shutdowns in Europe. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $36.9 million at the end of the first quarter, a decrease from $44.3 million at the end of the fiscal year due primarily to investments in inventory, higher accounts receivable, lower accounts payable and capital expenditures in excess of $1 million."
