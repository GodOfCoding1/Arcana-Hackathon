    "content": " We've now attained well over 20,000 prescriptions launched to-date with plenty of headroom for continued growth, as Frank mentioned, and our confidence continues to grow every week that we're providing the best topical treatment solution to plaque psoriasis patients. Our capital allocation priorities remain very targeted in 2023 prioritizing, of course, the ZORYVE launch in plaque psoriasis as well as preparations for the upcoming potential launches in seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis; and finally, the continued advancement of our pipeline, specifically our topical JAK program in alopecia areata and our CD200R program in atopic dermatitis. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think in the big picture, you're absolutely right, which is as you're writing -- the more you write, the more you get kind of covered -- the confidence sort of builds upon itself, and that's the intent, when we talked about the idea of sort of the faster and better coverage leading to ultimate conversion is -- one has to have that sort of underlying confidence with respect to if I'm going to do this, is it worth my time and is the patient going to end up on the therapy. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think that reading out two successful Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis, where we're not really seeing within our data or looking across other data in atopic dermatitis, a really significant difference in how patients are responding based on their age and especially considering the fact that INTEGUMENT-1 and 2 included a lot of pediatric patients from the ages of six, all the way up and including adolescents up to the age of 17. Your line is open. Your line is open."
