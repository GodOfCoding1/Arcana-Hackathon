    "content": " We're confident we have the right strategy and we certainly know that we've got the right product profile in ZORYVE continue to prove all of that and then to seek out additional reformat indications as we've talked about before, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. We saw in our trials only needing 8 weeks to get to the endpoint to get to a 40% IG success measure, but Patrick showed earlier this year that nearly every patient in the DERMIS study responded to our product and nearly 3 in 4 patients achieved a clinically meaningful response. And we've seen that with other products out there where they better buy down opportunities, very, very long the packets, cash offers, things that have -- don't really represent, I think, sort of the long-term sustainable type of demand that you won in the sense that at some point in time, that will have a material impact to your gross finance. So just kind of coming back to our data, we showed about 50% of patients between the 0.05 and the 0.15 in our Phase II study, getting to clear or almost clear and around a 30% vehicle rate on that endpoint. When we've looked over other data from both PDE4 inhibition in atopic dermatitis, topical treatments as well as systemic treatments, we're not really seeing how patients across these different age groups are responding differentially to therapies. Well, I mean, in terms of feedback, I think what we've heard very consistently is that they're impressed with the rapidity of ZORYVE's effect and the efficacy that they're seeing on -- particularly on tough to treat plaques. So I think Scott said earlier, we do expect within the time frame that we've talked about before 12 to 18 months that we would achieve that sort of steady-state growth that industry-wide, the benchmark is about 50%, which would represent great performance, frankly."
