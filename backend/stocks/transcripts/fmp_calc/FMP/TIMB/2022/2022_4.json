    "content": " We highlight that statements that may be made regarding the prospects, projections, and goals of TIM S.A. constitute the beliefs and assumptions of the company's board of executive officers. Now, I will turn the conference over to the CEO, Mr. Alberto Griselli, CEO of TIM S.A.; and to Ms. Vicente Ferreira, Head of Investor Relations, to present the main messages for the fourth quarter of 2022. Looking at our results and what we accomplished, I'm sure we did a great job. In April, we closed the deal with Oi and we started the immense job of integrating the assets with both. In June, the Reclame Aqui web portal recognized us for our customer service excellence. In the subsequent months, we leveraged 5G to differentiate in Brazil from our peers and to reinforce our innovation positioning. In the business pace, we pioneered partnership with industry leaders in several verticals such as agro business, automotive, and logistics. During the year, we became the operator with the broadest mobile coverage in Brazil. Our EBITDA also presented significant momentum, closing the year growing more than 17%, compared to 2021. The proxy for operating free cash flow rose more than 26% yearly, which helped us to fulfill our promise of BRL 2 billion in shareholder remuneration. These solid industrial and financial outcomes correspond to one more year of long-term responsible progress towards an integrated ESG agenda, reflected by the increase in all this sustainability rankings. Environmental management highlights the increasingly distributed, clear, renewable energy metrics and the continuous improvement of energy efficiency of network data traffic. In the social sphere, team has been recognized for the second consecutive year as the worldwide Telco best practice in diversity and inclusion policies, which contributes to making our company one of the great place to work. Moreover, being the first and only Brazilian operator to have reached 100% of Brazilian municipalities covered is an undoubted contribution to digital inclusion. Additionally, we are using the power of technology to help develop communities under a partnership with the NGO Gerando Falc\u00c3\u00b5es. So, when we say ESG is embedded in our strategy and everyday action, isn't just a claim. Now, entering into more details of our business performance, I want to highlight our revenue dynamics. In the fourth quarter, total net revenues grew more than 22% with a significant contribution from mobile services that expanded greatly to reach a speed of 23% year-over-year. For the full-year figures, service revenues showed an excellent performance growing more than 19% year-on-year, driven by double-digit growth in mobile and high-single-digit in fixed. Since the transactions closing with Oi, I've made this point every quarter. Our organic performance continues to be helped by the positive net effect of our commercial strategy, benign macro environment, and rational competition. Analyzing the segments individually, postpaid revenues in 2029 presented a solid pace, up more than 19% year-over-year with an ARPU excluding machine-to-machine lines of   in the fourth quarter. Prepaid revenues expanded more than 21% versus 2021, pointing to an ARPU of close to BRL 14. Nonetheless, TIM's customer base and ARPU were significantly affected by the acquisition of Oi assets. In 20 23, we should see a normalization in the volatility seen in those two indicators as we complete the cleanup of Oi customer base from lines that do not generate any traffic or revenues. In postpaid, we are sustaining our volume to value strategy with offer innovations such as Amazon Prime, and in-flight connectivity, and continuous improvement of service levels. As a matter of fact, last quarter we registered our best Black Friday. Since I'm talking about  impact on team indicators, let's go deeper into the integration details. We have completed the two most relevant steps of network integration, and we are well advanced in the last phase. As for client migration, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve totally completed the prepaid transition with close to 8 million lines moved to our systems. As you saw in November,  figures, we disconnected 5.1 million lines with zero traffic. Now, the customers are in our systems and we will continue to analyze their behavior and profile, eventually additional adjustment would be necessary. This quarter, we are also planning some migration of control lines to prepaid to reflect the real customer's behavior. Different from the other two, this activity started in October last year and will accelerate in 2023 following the end of the antitrust required offering period. Our scheduled point to 3,000 sites being dismantled this year, leaving more than 1,000 sites for 2024. Still on mobile, let's discuss the evolution of our network. During the year, important milestones were achieved. Firstly, our indisputable leadership in 4G was confirmed. Secondly, we had started in 5G, having the most available network and being leader in key capital such as S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Recife as the result of our all-in 5G deployment approach. Lastly, in the second half of 2022, we achieved the broadest mobile coverage and in early January this year we reached 100% of Brasilia municipalities. In the next couple of years, we will see this transformation materialize. As I say last quarter, the 5G launch is a success. Additionally, the technology is starting to contribute to 4G CapEx avoidance as traffic of load exceed 10%. As we move forward with our strategic plan, would assume focus on going beyond the telecom core. They are the largest popular medical cleaning network in the country present in all states with more than 400 clinics, covering 100% of the cities with more than 90,000 inhabitants. We plan to launch a   to facilitate access to health services, starting with a premium offer to help build a distinctive value proposition. With this partnership and following LGPD rules, we can also offer and sell our telecom services to a client base of   customers that use their clinics. The novelty marks the beginning of a new moment in the history of TIM FTTH services, elected six times at the best broadband in Brazil by Estad\u00c3\u00a3o\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Best Services Award. The name change aims to bring the service even closest to consumers, generating a clear and immediate association with its attribute of very high download and upload speeds. Back to 2022, our focus was to guarantee a smooth transition to the new operational model using I-Systems as our network partner not impacting the growth profile of the broadband services. We expanded the client base by mid-single digit, while doing a massive migration from FTTC to FTTH. Now, we have more than 70% of our user, which speeds above 150 megabit per second, better services driving improvements in customer experience and satisfaction, while helping churn to reduce. As a result of our efforts to grow sustainably with the high value service and portfolio, we maintain robust FTTH ARPU level of close to   despite competitive pressure. Thank you, Alberto, and good morning, everyone. As explained earlier, the fourth quarter, as well as the full-year figures point to robust performance in all relevant lines of our results. Even in the face of important challenges, such as the high inflation level in early 2022. Our OpEx line was impacted by this inflationary environment, as well as other elements such as temporary service agreement with Oi, additional costs, and expenses due to a more extensive customer and infrastructure base and the rental costs for the  . In this context, fourth quarter EBITDA sustained an excellent performance, growing close to 20% year-over-year combining organic evolution and M&A contribution. As for the full-year, EBITDA rose more than 17% margins stood at 50% in 4Q and 47.4% in 2022. If we excluded the impacts of I-Systems' rental costs, the EBITDA margin would have been 51.2% in the quarter and 49% for the year. As we discussed in prior quarters, TIM Brasil is passing through transformations that impose transitory impacts on its results. Those short-term elements will disappear in 2024, but improvements will already be noticed in 2023. Having said that, looking exclusively at our net income performance can be deceiving. To put in perspective, more than BRL 1 billion was added between depreciation and interest related to the leasing contracts without necessarily the same cash impact. So, a better way of understanding our evolution is to use metrics of operating free cash flow. As a result, despite posting a contraction in net income, we were able to deliver on the BRL 2 billion promise we made. RMB 1.4 billion was already paid, and the additional 600 million are being proposed in the end of shareholders meeting. Ending my comments, I want to point out the strength of our cash position even in a year with relevant disbursements. This performance helped maintain a healthy leverage level with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio reaching 1.4x, below our guidance for this metric. Double-digit service revenue growth, check; double-digit EBITDA growth, check; investment of  , check; free cash flow margin above 24%, check; in-depthness below 2x EBITDA, check; and 2 billion in shareholder remuneration, finally check. Nonetheless, despite the tough comps, our updated plan points to a better overall business dynamic when compared to our regional expectation for 2023. We are forecasting a significant expansion in free cash flow margin, some improvements in EBITDA margin, both driven by efficiency and synergy that will improve transfer revenues, OpEx, CapEx, and leases. I'm reaching the end of my comments, so I want to share how grateful I am to close this first year as CEO of this fantastic company. No doubt that building this new chapter in team history is taking a huge effort, but I'm very confident we will get there. Looking back, it was worthwhile going the extra mile. With no further delays, let's open the floor for questions. So, let me take these two questions. So, on the first one, regarding the competitive environment, I think that when you look at the past months and you look at the overall dynamics, both for prepaid and postpaid that the market has been relatively rational , I would say over the last 18 months. As you know, this is a market where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a sector, we were unable to pass through inflation for many, many years to the entry prices. There are some price adjustment happening, the market leader updated its control and postpaid prices. So, overall, I think that this rationality is going to stay in the coming months. When it comes to the lease, the commissioning plan, here it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so as you know, we got a quite ambitious decommissioning plan that started in October last year with decommission a bit more than 500 towers in 2022 starting October and we plan to decommission another 3,000 towers in the course of 2023. In-line of principle, I think we can say that it takes roughly three months to move from the physical decommissioning to the financial impact. So, when you look at the quarter, which is the question that you asked, you will see the number ramping up over time. So, as we move forward with the physical decommissioning, with the delay of roughly 90 days, on average, you will see this appearing in our lease payments. So, the first quarter is going to be the full value. And when we move to the last quarter, in the last quarter, we will accumulate the saving of the physical decommissioning of the   portal. So, you can monitor the effectiveness of our plan looking at the decrease of the lease cost on a quarter-by-quarter basis. In our calculation here for this year, it remained at single digits. Fred, let me start with the CapEx question and then we'll move \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I will ask Vicente to answer the tax rate question. So, on the CapEx one, as you know, our CapEx last year and this year has been impacted by, let's say, a few things that are one-off like the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 primarily the Oi integration. And of course, the deployment of 5G technology that at the beginning, you see the CapEx that we deployed for a quick start while the revenue tends to build up later on in time. So, when we commented in the previous quarters, we already say that one of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when you look at the Oi acquisition, one the most important synergy comes from the infrastructure side. So, what we are talking here, it's a nominal reduction in CapEx driven by these effects, that are industrial effects. And therefore, anticipating some of the previous planned targets like going below the 20% marker of CapEx on revenues. So, regarding the effective tax rate, first of all, I think it's important to highlight that we don't have a specific guidance for effective tax rate. So, let's talk just about the drivers. So, what is driving our effective tax rate today is, as you well mentioned, is interest on capital. So, basically, the drivers will remain the same in 2023. So, the broad framework that is driving our effective tax rate is going to be pretty much the same. So, that's basically what we can say right now. So, Bernardo, as you correctly pointed out, we are now working with two partners, I-System and  . So, I-System is focusing on deploying new clusters building up fiber. And so, the plan here is to deploy the new fiber deployment, generally speaking, where we do not find additional near-term networks, because we think this is an efficient way to move forward. The   partnership, it's a growth of optionality that we negotiated last year, whereby we can have access to a larger footprint because the fiber is already built up and generally always their main tenant. So, as you know, Paran\u00c3\u00a1, it's a place where our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are leader in mobile, both on postpaid and prepaid. And I think that we're going to be able to share with you a bit more detail in the next quarter when we, let's say, we consolidated the results. So far, the launch of the new brand and the offering and the commercial network is proceeding very well, but it's sort of early stages because we launched just a few weeks ago. But the idea is to use Vital as a complement to I-System, where I-System doesn't have coverage and doesn't plan to put coverage. Also, Victor, let's put this way. So, the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I was mentioning, it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the mobile market, basically, we do, we implement a more for more strategy, generally speaking, of our customer base. To make this strategy sustainable in the long-term, of course, we're always discussing the opportunity to do this at the entry point as well. Also, because these prices have not been adjusted for many, many years now and so we are not be able to pass inflation always on a more for more approach at the point of sales. So, as you correctly mentioned, the market leader in postpaid made the change a couple of days ago this week. And we were planning, we were starting this opportunity ourselves, and I think that the market is going in the right direction. We pioneered some price adjustment in prepaid where we are, sort of co-leader starting last year and always on a more for more approach. So, I think it's where the market is probably heading in the next month. Without any more questions from analysts, we will now start the public Q&A session from the webcast platform, and will be read by Mr. Vicente. So, the first question comes from, mainly from . And he goes, Oi subscriber cleanup, excluding Oi subscriber cleanup there was a 1 million postpaid subs versus negative versus 3Q 2022. And so, the first one, let's put this way in our organic business. So, our organic business, let's put this pre-Oi is growing in net additions, constantly over time as it was growing in the first quarter and in the second quarter. Then of course, we got a new layer, which is primarily related to Oi in the fourth quarter, also to some cleanup that we do on our customer base. So, on the Oi side, basically, we have three main effects happening in the customer base. The first one is the cleanup of the customer base, which is around 5 million customers that we canceled in November. We basically finalized the cancellation, but as we migrated the customer to our own systems, there might be some fine tuning in the first quarter. The second one, which is also happening is related to the reclassification of control lines as prepaid. So, when you look at Oi customer base, they called, they labeled actually as control some customers that are actually prepaid in behavior. So, this customer recharged to user service. Day spending is much lower, our control plans. And so, we are in the process of reclassifying these lines, control lines as prepaid. The reason in the first clean-up scenario and in the reclassification scenario, no impact on revenues. And by migrating a control customer to prepaid, we are more effective in monetizing the prepaid customers as we move forward because our    action and offer are designed for that specific customer segment. In the third quarter, and so I finally get to the question that has been asked, the additional cancellation that we had are related to a couple of business contracts. If you look at the Anatel numbers and you split it up by consumer and postpaid and the business, you will see around 5,000 lines cancel. This is because \u00e2\u0080\u0093 500,000 lines cancel. This is because in the course of 2002 and 2001, some governments launched educational programs with a significant volume of lines at low ARPU. We came to the end of two contractors, summing up to roughly half a million customers. And then as the last point, there is some clean up that we took the opportunity to execute on our customer base. So, it's regarding bad debt. So, in terms of the overall performance of bad debt, actually, our bad debt as a percentage of revenues decreased. If this question is raised on an annual comparison, the recent increase because there are some adjustment that we mentioned in the last quarter of last year on a year-on-year comparison, but our bad debt performance is improving over time and therefore the weight of bad debt on our revenues is going down, accounts has been going down constantly in 2022. Now, when we look at the collection curves, and this is a very positive piece of information in terms of the health of our business, the collection curves have been improving over time, therefore, showing the ability of collecting money from our customers. The improvement of collection curves results and improvement of bad debt in terms of revenues is correct that the customer coming from Oi as a slightly higher bad debt versus our own customers, this is an opportunity for us to further improve bad debt by bringing the efficiency of our collection process to Oi customers in the course of this year. Well, Bruno, there is not much actually that I can share on this contract because it's a commercial contract that is specific to us. I would say that we have a contractor that provide us a payback, which is in-line with our business plan and expectations. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in terms of specific numbers of contractual terms, unfortunately, we do not share these with the market. An important point that is worth mentioning is that since we are second tenant, we do not have volume commitment or obligations with our partner. Well, , we will actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this 1.4x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below what we expected in the beginning of the year. Of course, we will have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we expect to improve significantly our free cash flow. This can be to opportunities for us to either have a better indebtedness level, as well as distributing more to our shareholders. So basically, that's what we can say right now. Again, on the 14th next week, we'll be able to disclose more information regarding guidance and future expectations, but for now, I think that's it. So, when it comes to FWA, we explained the way we look at it in our Investor Day in May last year. So, as you know, the first point is to have coverage. And so, we at TIM as we mentioned, we will enter with an all-in coverage approach in main capitals. So, for example, if you take Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, our 5G coverage is already a pretty widespread. So, for example, we closed  an agreement with Itau to put FWA in all their branches in some of their branches, and so we are working actively to extend this approach in the business segment. In the consumer segment, besides coverage, that is addressing some of the key capitals, one other aspects that today limits the adoption of SWA is the availability of CP at affordable prices. Now, given to the increase of scale around the globe and the commitment of some equipment manufacturer in Brazil, to reduce prices, this barrier is likely to be addressed by the end of this year. At that point, we will be in the position to leverage this opportunity in the consumer segment where we already have coverage. So, it's something that we're going to put in our pipeline likely at the end of this year to be commercially active in 2024. I think it is fair to say that we enter 2023 as a bigger and more robust TIM Brasil in a more favorable Telco environment and with a significant cash flow expansion opportunity, in front of us. In a couple of days, we are going to share with you the updated guidance. I look forward to meeting some of you in the one-to-one meetings in the coming weeks, and thank you for attending our conference call. Thus we conclude the fourth quarter of 2022 conference call of TIM S.A. For further information and details of the company, please access our website tim.com.br/ir."
