    "content": " Over 30% of our lease has expire between July and September, and we expect same-store NOI growth to be higher in the second half of the year as the combination of rate increases earned into our rent roll and final pandemic leases rolling off drives higher overall growth in rental income. Beyond what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already reflected in our loss-to-lease, average effective market rent growth is expected to be approximately 11% for the Atlanta region and 6% for the Washington metro area for 2023, according to RealPage data. Average effective monthly rent per home for the quarter increased 7% compared to the prior year on a same-store basis, which also represents a substantial improvement compared to the 3% year-over-year growth achieved last quarter. Other NOI, which represents Watergate 600, grew 9.6% in the second quarter compared to the prior year, driven by higher rental income for new leasing and rent increases as well as increased parking usage. With same-store NOI growth expected through the third quarter of 2023 expected to average in the double-digits and even higher growth from our non-same-store communities, our outlook is certainly much better than it was a year ago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just literally -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got projections going out for the year, but I think the second quarter was our peak as we looked at just the aging of receivables, the whole clock on getting repossession of units back flips at the beginning of the third quarter, and we were -- it was just a little bit extended there."
