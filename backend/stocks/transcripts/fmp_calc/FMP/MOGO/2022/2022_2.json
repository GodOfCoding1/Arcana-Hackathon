    "content": " Specifically, in the first quarter of 2020, we were able to dial back our cash OpEx by almost 15% along with our high recurring revenue component, resulting in us generating an average of $5 million of adjusted EBITDA or approximately 50% adjusted EBITDA margins over the subsequent two quarters before we decided to resume our growth again in Q4 of 2020. So obviously, then we've taken a meaningful charge this quarter on a non-cash charge, but we remain big believers in that as an asset class going forward, especially for the next generation and one that we're excited to have a meaningful investment that we believe, in the long run -- in the medium to long run, is going to going to provide meaningful opportunity for our investors. I mean our plan is to continue to grow our member base, and I guess what I would say is we expect once we kind of launch MogoTrade marketing campaign, really, everything we're doing is try to sort of set us up so we hit the ground running in Q1 and are in a position to see accelerating growth and including net member additions quarterly in 2023."
