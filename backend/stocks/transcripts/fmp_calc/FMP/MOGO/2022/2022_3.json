    "content": " Although the current crypto volatility and specific company related issues with companies like FTX have been painful for a lot of people in this sector, we believe this is only going to accelerate what we have always believed, that the future of crypto, at least in North America, will be within a regulated environment with regulated crypto exchanges, which is exactly why we believe Coin Square is the first and at this point, the only regulated crypto only exchange in Canada and for that matter, North America is very well positioned for the future of this industry. However, we believe that will better position Mogo to manage through this period with our existing capital while also making us more efficient company that continue to focus on long-term growth opportunities through our broad product portfolio, including exposure to innovative digital wealth solutions, like MogoWealth to help Canadians invest and built wealth."
