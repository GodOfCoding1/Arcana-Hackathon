    "content": " One of the outcomes of the recent restructuring and efficiency initiatives, is our increased focus will be placing on Carta's payment business going forward, given what we see as attractive long-term growth opportunities in the massive TAM of over $2.5 trillion. While we focus on adjusted EBITDA growth, we will also continue to invest in our two primary growth platforms of digital wealth and payments, which we believe will position us well for profitable top line expansion in 2024. But by far and away, our primary focus is on cash, getting to cash flow, continue to expand our EBITDA on our business and preserving the cash on our balance sheet, but we will -- as we've done in '22, but I think we will look opportunistically when it makes sense to potentially do some other buybacks."
