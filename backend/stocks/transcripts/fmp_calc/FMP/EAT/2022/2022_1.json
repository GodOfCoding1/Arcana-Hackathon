    "content": "  Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Brinker International Q1 F'22 Earnings Call. With me on today's call are Wyman Roberts, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Joe Taylor, our Chief Financial Officer. As many of you know, we pre-released limited results for the first quarter, ahead of our Investor Day hosted here in Dallas on October 20. Since we have recently shared details regarding the first quarter, Wyman and Joe will make prepared comments related to our operating performance and then we will open the call and jump straight to your questions. And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. What you should have taken away from that was this, we're very optimistic about where the business is going. We're managing for long-term success, and we're confident in the strength of our brands and the levers we have yet to pull to continue to grow the business. From a top line perspective, we're sitting in a good spot. As you know, there are -- these are the same challenges impacting the industry as well as much as the economy. But after 40 years in this business, I'll take managing costs over searching for sales and traffic any day. Our operators are working extremely hard every day to train our new team members, deliver great guest experiences and tying up the middle of the P&L. As I mentioned during Investor Day, we're not going to price to buy a quarter. But as we closely monitor the issues, we've layered in incremental pricing to offset what we believe are the structural labor and cost of sales increases. Moving forward, if we discover that what we thought was transitory, it turns out to be more structural, we'll deal with that from a pricing perspective with a disciplined approach that protects our traffic performance and keeps our brands strong. We know we have pricing power if we need it, particularly in the delivery in virtual brand channels, and we're committed to maintaining our margins and our business model. We're also working hard to remove transitory costs from the system with full recognition that the headwinds are notable and persistent, especially around labor. And while it takes some time, we're confident with the progress we're making and we will significantly reduce these costs by the back half of the year. The good news is we are quickly building staff and have as many team members now as we did pre-COVID, though there are markets that are still not fully staffed, which is limiting their capacity. This is particularly true in the Midwest, where it's taking longer to reach these optimum levels. The impact of these staffing challenges cost us 3% to 4% in first quarter in sales, which we view as upside as we -- as we get those restaurants staffed and trained over the coming months. When we look at the totality of the business, Chili's is running positive sales and traffic and maintaining a sizable traffic gap to the industry, most recently at 9% on a 2-year look as measured by NAFTrack. And while the last quarter was more challenging than we expected, we're making great progress, and my expectation is we will end the year strong. And as we shared with you during Investor Day, we've got exciting initiatives and innovation we're working on, and we're confident in our future growth opportunities. During first quarter, top line sales performed well and outpaced pre-COVID levels by a very respectable amount despite COVID-related constraints. For the first quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $860 million with consolidated comp sales of 17%. Keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic up 11% for the quarter, a 9% beat versus the industry on a 2-year look. The top line increase resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, up from $0.28 in the previous fiscal year. It will come as no surprise, our most significant challenge during the quarter came in the form of industry-wide headwinds from both commodity costs and labor-related spend, which negatively impacted our margins and bottom line flow through. We experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken driving the increase. As Wyman mentioned, with a greater-than-normal influx of new team members, we experienced outsized costs in training and overtime. We do consider the portion of these costs above our normal operating levels to be transitory, approximately 130 basis points in the quarter, 60 of which are incremental training and overtime costs. In the near term, I expect a significant portion of these transitory costs to remain in the system for the second quarter. Following this increase, Chili's will be carrying a total of 3% of incremental price compared to last year. Of course, the mid-quarter price action will not fully impact the total price reported for the quarter. Due to the timing of price actions and the fact that Maggiano's will evaluate its menu pricing after the holiday season, we expect the second quarter blended Brinker price to be closer to 2%. Our cash flow for the first quarter remained strong, with cash from operating activities of $40 million and EBITDA of $69 million. When compared to first quarter last year, our strength in operating performance and lower level of outstanding debt have combined to improve our balance sheet and leverage position. Our total funded debt leverage was 2.6x, and our lease-adjusted leverage ended the quarter at 3.7x. As indicated during our recent Investor Day, we are targeting to move these leverage ratios below 2x and 3x, respectively, over the course of the next 2 years. In addition, this morning's press release included incremental guidance for both Brinker's annual revenues and annual adjusted earnings per share. Specifically, annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and annual adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80. This incorporates our current view of the casual dining operating environment, which assumes continuing challenges in the near term, especially related to supply chain and labor issues. This guidance, both reiterated and new, assumes no additional meaningful top line COVID-related disruptions. While guidance is for our fiscal year performance, I can provide some directional thoughts related to the second quarter. With the exception of banquet sales at Maggiano's, we expect sales to exhibit closer to normal holiday seasonality, although impacted by labor shortage constraints in certain markets. As mentioned earlier in my comments, restaurant operating margins for the second quarter will again be impacted by higher food and beverage and labor costs. We do expect restaurant operating margin to improve when compared to both the recently completed first quarter as well as the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter at a level comparable to the pre-COVID second quarter of fiscal year '20. We firmly believe our strategic initiatives focused on driving traffic in organic top line growth will differentiate our performance over time with the overall benefit to our team members, our guests and importantly, our shareholders. With my comments now complete, let's turn it back to Kate and move on to any questions. And they talked about as the stimulus is easing off, they're seeing more employees come back into the driving pool. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned, we're back to pre-pandemic levels of staffing in the system. We've got these hotspots still, but we've been averaging about 1,000 new team members a week over the last month. And just a second and last question, I think we all understand the price now, how it's being dictated, how and when it will flow through. And whether that -- we use multiple ways of testing that out, if you will, some of them in market, some of them through research to just understand the sensitivity to this pricing. The good news is the pricing that we're taking has been tested both from a consumer perspective conceptually, but also in market. And we're feeling really good about the responses and the strength of the value propositions post price, and that gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue the traffic momentum that we have post the price increase that Joe had mentioned is coming here in the next couple of days. Nicole, and I would add to the equation as we broadened into multichannels, I mean, again, when you think about pricing experiences where we're typically taking a broad-based menu oriented price, there was probably a lot more clarity around realizing that price. And there's probably some greater sensitivities when you start thinking about price in different channels or geared towards specific products, where consumers can move within channels or they can move from one product to another more readily. First, in terms of COGS for this year, definitely going to be elevated. I think we've been talking about this year, we've been pretty clear that we expected more COGS inflation to hit the system in the second half as you roll through some of the contracts we have in place. So our line of sight to the -- our expectations around food and beverage costs, I think, is pretty tight right now. We are seeing, again, some markets at extremely high levels compared to historical norms, pork, in particular, chicken being the other one. We are anticipating high levels, but there's also probably some opportunity as those markets may normalize. But again, I'm feeling good about what we have embedded from a cost of sales perspective into our COGS around the fiscal year. In terms of comps dynamic within the current quarter, what are you guys seeing in terms of versus the number you gave quarter-to-date, mainly Chili's and Maggiano's as well, at your Investor Day and then the update you gave today, maybe a little bit of a acceleration there. Yes, Jared, I hate to be talking about week-to-week traffic and sales changes but because we did give you two data points, there's really not much in that. The related data point we gave you a couple of weeks ago was that average weekly sales and showing how they had started to move back up again in October, and that situation is very much still in place. I think you mentioned fiscal 2Q would be comparable to the second quarter of '19, which if my model is correct, is about 12.7%. And also, I think you discussed a lot more inflation will hit the P&L in the second half, but perhaps some of the transitory costs are all over that time. I know you've got this 3- to 5-year outlook, which calls for 50 basis points on top of the '19...\n Eric, to clarify, it's a big one for you. It's not '19, I said '20. So I'll just refer you back to my comments that, again, moving up from what we saw in the first quarter and above what we saw last year, which is fiscal '21 and then comparable to that F '20 number. So then as you look at the second half of the year with some of that more inflation coming on, but also the transitory costs rolling off, should we assume that the margin is maybe flat to how should we think about that versus the 13.2% baseline you established at the Analyst Day? I think there\u2019s \u2013 assuming there\u2019s those two events and the normal seasonality we have, remember, third and fourth quarters are our higher volume quarters. We\u2019re not going to get into that specific level, but I would expect to see normal seasonality patterns play in those quarters. At Chili's, our traffic patterns during the holidays are elevated, but they're not extreme. You have some -- you just have a couple of bigger days, if you will, a few more weekend days during the week, almost is one way to think about it at Chili's. And we absolutely have -- feel good about, as I mentioned, where we're moving with regard to staffing. But for the most part, we feel pretty good about being able to be staffed and ready for the holidays at Chili's. Maggiano's again, bigger issue, especially if we see the kind of historic demand for banquet business and large groups, which we think we're feeling pretty good about right now. And that may be a little bit more of a headwind, but I think they're -- we're going to be fully staffed to handle the business we expect. Now whether the -- if the environment is overheated, we may not be able to take all the potential business that we could have gotten if it just becomes a really kind of a gangbuster kind of holiday season. But they've got plenty of staff and management now in place to handle what we anticipate being a solid holiday, probably not a record-setting holiday. And then secondly, I was hoping for kind of, I guess, a real-time education of what you're seeing in the chicken market. I mean we -- as an industry, kind of you saw stable boneless, skinless breast prices for years. I mean they kind of -- we're in a fairly tight range and obviously, are very elevated now. And as you're kind of thinking about the chicken contract as that comes up for renewal, I mean, I guess, how much rest do you think there could be that we'll be looking at fiscal '23 versus '22 as another escalated year of commodity increases? Yes, John, it's set to pinpoint exactly what I said to be transitory and structural there. I think it's a high level of transitory again, what we're hearing is, obviously, it's not an issue of number of chickens. And we're hearing anecdotally from partners that they're seeing better hiring rates, very similar kinds of patterns that as they work through some of the systems, we would expect to see greater production capacities, which should definitely impact the price as you go forward. Our chicken contract runs well into the -- well, it runs into the fourth quarter, into the April time frame. So while you start those conversations in real time as to what that look like, we're going to watch that very closely as we move through the next several months and start moving more towards dates that you might traditionally commit for new contracts and keep our options as broad as we can there for as long as we can. We've got good partners to work with in this regard, and we'll work it actively as we kind of move towards that April kind of time frames. There\u2019s nothing \u2013 if you just look at that market over the last, really almost 10 years, there\u2019s nothing structurally that\u2019s changed besides maybe some of the labor component costs that aren\u2019t going to \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t support the kind of potential inflation that\u2019s out there now. So we think it\u2019s going to mitigate to some degree, and we\u2019ll make some bets based on that thinking, going forward. From this guidance, David, I'm almost taking those in reverse, from a average wage, we expect that to be in -- elevated as to what we've seen in the last several years, but in that upper mid-single-digit range. So if you're thinking 6%, 7%, that's been a fairly consistent range as of late, and we're incorporating that into our thinking for this fiscal year. Obviously, we've talked a lot about the opportunities we see around deploying TSC. It's out in most of the system, and we're getting close, really within the next several weeks of getting that fully deployed. We like it as a labor operating system in the front of the house because, one, we think it's the best guest service model we can deploy. So we're not anticipating a step change in any way, shape or form a number of hours having to flow back in, you will get hours in the second half of the year naturally from a seasonality standpoint. So from this point, I think volumes will dictate the amount of hours flowing in the system, and we would expect to see greater hours as we have success on the top line in Q3 and Q4 that we normally would expect to see. And then I wanted to ask you a question that we talked about during the...\n And David, by the way, yes, and that the number for the fiscal year, the target we talked about at Investor Day is still definitely in play that mid-34s. And I know there is -- you effectively want to get these virtual brands launched and there's been a lot of outsized inflation perhaps in wings and -- but delivery fees, there's a lot of players out there pricing this along to the consumer, and the consumer seems to be taking it because they're willing to pay up for convenience. And just to remind you, there are certain things we don\u2019t do in delivery, like the value proposition that is 3 for $10 or 3 for $10.99. So one of the ways we address some of the issues you\u2019re talking about, there is additional price. So we are already pricing at a premium, and we will continue to look at how much more of a premium we need to get to make that channel carry its weight, if you will. So between those 2 things, between the mix and the price, we will continue to make sure that the delivery channel is carrying its weight and delivering good returns. Without getting into details, we continue to appreciate our partnership with DoorDash and as we look to expand channels with other third parties and other ways to grow the business like our own websites, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the relationship we have with DoorDash. And then as a follow-up, at the Investor Day you shared and it's just Wings P&L, it showed marketing expense at about 9% of sales. So obviously, we\u2019re very excited about our 2 virtual brands. But to your point, the beauty of how we market these brands is it\u2019s very trackable. And I will say, again, in the first year, 1.5 years, we\u2019ve made some decisions that haven\u2019t paid out as well, but we now understand where we\u2019re getting the best bang for the buck in the marketing programs and how to push these brands forward and build them in the various channels that we\u2019re now moving towards. And as we establish these brands, establish their customers through loyalty, specific loyalty programs we\u2019re building around them, that we\u2019ll see that number come down. Second, when you think about pricing, you've obviously stepped up your levels and you've had a greater frequency of adding price to the menu. Because obviously, you're in line with some but short of others. Yes, we're not -- we tend to not benchmark against peers. And I guess, the biggest question we have and what we've reiterated to the group here is what we see as structural, we feel pretty good about having that covered, but we do have a fairly significant transitory bucket, if you will, that we're working down. And if for some reason, the changes in the environment that have been really primarily COVID-related, if those tend to be more structural now, then we'll have to take some more pricing as we move forward. No, the beauty of what we\u2019ve been doing really prior to the pandemic is we haven\u2019t been \u2013 we weren\u2019t an LTO promo-driven concept. And so that\u2019s why our value propositions and the base business is so important to us, because that\u2019s what we drive this business from. We\u2019d much rather be working off a stable day in, day out proposition for guests that we know resonates well."
