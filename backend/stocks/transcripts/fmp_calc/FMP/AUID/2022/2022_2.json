    "content": " It's why we have centered a lot of our marketing and sales around that And we think that we are uniquely positioned because as most companies are moving towards passwordless where you no longer will log into your corporate environment with a user name and password, but rather have a past key or a token on your phone the way to step up that authentication to make sure you know who is behind the phone is with a biometric. And then when there is either something risky you're doing, maybe you're accessing a certain area of information inside the company or an area that the data is more - has a much greater loss if it is breached, then the user is challenged to make sure it's them and basically ask to turn the phone to their face and verify their identity with the biometric. If you look at the telecommunications opportunity that we're speaking to, it serve small and medium businesses that need to secure their employees and make sure that the person that is using the device provided by that wireless telecommunications company is the person that's supposed to be and finally, talking about a large cybersecurity company that is separate from the telecommunications company, they see the same opportunities and are implementing identity and access management solutions and realize that in cases of either high risk or sensitivity, they want to make sure who is behind the device, and we are best positioned to offer that because that has been our entire focus."
