    "content": " In Q3, we experienced sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, both overall and within the key illumin self-serve category, where we had particular success in attracting new clients to the firm, and we will continue to capitalize on this demand and support this growth into 2023. We are really, really, really focused on the illumin self-serve, all the metrics that come from the top of the funnel, bringing in more demos getting contracts signed and getting those customers to sign the contract to start betting on system. Okay, thank you very much. I would say we are more sensitive to cash burn, but EBITDA is less important for us for the next few quarters because we are really, really the adoption of illumin self-serve, and that is what we are focusing on that and we are making investments in that. Okay, thank you very much."
