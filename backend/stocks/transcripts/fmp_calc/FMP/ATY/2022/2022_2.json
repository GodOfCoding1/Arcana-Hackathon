    "content": " So when we saw last year, at the same time, Q2 of 2021, we saw $5.2 million revenue from illumin and in Q2 2020 up 96% at $10.2 million in revenue. So we've communicated in the past that we made some investment in Q1 of this year, we set up a dedicated team, and we're starting to see great results for it, still early days, but looking in Q3 of 2021, we hardly had any revenue coming from self serve illumin, we now have over a $1 million in q3 and the future is looking rosy for that as well. Our total revenue was $28.million, an increase of 19% over Q1 at $23.8 and a decline of 7% from the Q2 of last year to $30.3. Our managed services component of that revenue was $18.2 million in the second quarter of this year, compared to $23.6 in Q2 2021, a decrease of 23%. Year-to-date illumin revenue is $18.1 million for the six months ending June 30, up over 118% for the same period last year. So for closing, I'd like to highlight that in Q2, we saw a tremendous improvement in growth in self-serve illumin, which is something that we're very excited about, and we're very focused on and we're going to work very hard to increase those numbers into the future."
