    "content": " We delivered $7.9 million in revenue, that's up 145% from Q1 of last year. And in addition to the impact of the large concentrated campaign, the decline was driven by increased focus on self-serve revenue, which at 8.1 million increased 56% year-over-year from 5.2 million in Q1 2021. And illumin in Q1 this year was 7.9 million or 33% of our total revenue versus 3.2 million, or 12% in the comparable 2021 period. And in summary, despite a challenging economic environment, we believe that through our actions, we're putting in place a strong foundation for future growth, especially for game changing illumin platform, expanding efficiency, managing operating expenses and maximizing cash flow remain key objectives, but the overarching priority is building a platform for growth for the second half of 2022 and in subsequent periods. If I may remind you $11 million this year's was in -- earmarked for growth, 70% of that was for marketing and sales and we\u2019re on the way to making all those investment. As we shared last time, we believe that we're going to see 20% to 25% top line growth this year, and the majority of it is going to come in the second half. And so I believe it's going to be more than 50%, but we're hoping that way more than 50%, I mean, the whole idea is what we would like to do and the things that we're building within illumin to be able to start moving more and more of our existing clients into illumin and eventually, we want to eliminate the -- to eliminate the old system."
