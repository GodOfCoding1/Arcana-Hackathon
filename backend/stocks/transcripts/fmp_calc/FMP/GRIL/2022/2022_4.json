    "content": " Sadot was formed in October 2022 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Muscle Maker, Inc. Its purpose was to diversify the company's operations and lines of business from the local U.S. restaurant and franchising business and catapult us into the global food supply chain. By achieving this net income threshold and the execution of the agreement, AGGIA nominated and Muscle Maker approved the addition of 2 new Board members who bring extensive experience in the food supply chain and international business. The restaurant division generated company restaurant sales net of discounts of $10,300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $9,321,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In this Sadot service agreement with AGGIA, AGGIA earns Muscle Maker shares at a premium share price of $1.5625 per share and can earn up to 14,424,275 shares, which is the equivalent to generating $22,538,000 in net income in Sadot."
