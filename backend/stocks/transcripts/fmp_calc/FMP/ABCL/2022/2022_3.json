    "content": " So I think a way to think about the program starts going forward is that the roughly what we've seen in the past year or so will probably be a good indication of what's going to be in the future, we still have a full book of work from the large number of 164 programs under contract, which our partners will continue to call with whatever frequency that they determined is correct. We do see as we are doing more work, we do see the value of each of these programs to AbCellera increasing, I think most notably, and probably in the extreme in the co-ownership case where that Carl mentioned where we have actually a 50% ownership stake, as we start those programs, and then an option to invest in order to maintain that 50% ownership stake going forward."
