    "content": " Of note, fiber construction revenue from electric utilities was $82.4 million in the quarter and increased organically 53.6% year-over-year. In fact, over the last several years, we believe we have meaningfully increased the long-term value of our maintenance and operations business, a trend which we believe will parallel our deployment of gigabit wireline direct and wireless/wireline converged networks as those deployments dramatically increase the amount of outside plant network that must be extended and maintained. So Sean -- and I think we commented on this on the last call that when you have a really strong year and we've had a really strong first three quarters, it's not unusual for the fourth quarter to be somewhat weaker. We have $80 million of equipment on order and we're looking at an order on one particular type of equipment that would be the largest, I think, probably in the company's history. I think it's also helpful when we see customers that have large, announced growth plans where we're in -- where we've already got existing facilities so that we can get operating leverage initially rather than having to go through the start-up phase from a facilities perspective."
