Your line is open. Your line is open. I think as we talked about on the last call Brent; I mean, clearly we're able to grow the business, so we're encouraged with AT&T in excess of 31% total but probably the more interesting number, Brent, is that on the wireline side of the business, it was in excess of 75% year-over-year organically. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Good morning, Steve and Drew. Your line is open. Good morning, Steve and Drew. Your line is open. Your line is open. So for example, if you think about what we mentioned in our comments in the slides that we had 6 of our Top 10 customers, just in the last year, initiate plans for over 40 million homes of fiber-to-the-home.
