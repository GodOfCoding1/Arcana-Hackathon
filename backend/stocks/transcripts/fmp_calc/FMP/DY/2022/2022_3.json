    "content": " General and administrative expenses were 7.8% of revenue and all of these factors produced adjusted EBITDA of $83.1 million or 9.7% of revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $0.95, compared to earnings per share of $1.6 in the year ago quarter, included in adjusted earnings per share our incremental tax benefits of $0.10 per share for credits related to tax filings for prior periods. Of note, fiber construction revenue from electric utilities was $53.7 million in the quarter and increased organically 75.3% year-over-year. Your line is open. And so, I think what the highest level way to think about this is to say in rural America the industry said without -- historically the industry has said that without support 20% of America didn't make sense to deploy high-capacity networks in, I think if you look back from 10-years from now that the government support will effectively have addressed, if not all of it, the vast majority of it. Your line is open. So I think that's in line, we did make good progress -- on our great progress, we expect that progress to continue in the fourth quarter and then I think as we get into the next fiscal year, we don't see any reason in the rest of the business to be outside of our normal range. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
