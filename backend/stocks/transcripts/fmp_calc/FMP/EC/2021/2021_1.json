    "content": " The increase in net income compared to the first quarter of 2020 is primarily explained by higher EBITDA of COP 2.9 trillion as a result of the following factors: first, improved prices had a greater impact of the exchange rate of income and purchases of about COP 1.7 trillion, second, a positive variation in inventory valuations of nearing COP 1.3 trillion, as a result of better market prices for crude oil and products, third, a lower cost of operational activity for COP 356 billion, which includes rescheduling of activities and realized efficiencies, fourth, a decrease in labor costs and expenses of COP 39 billion, mainly related to the lower average personnel given the voluntary retirement plan of previous year, fifth, a negative volumetric net effect of COP 257 billion, explained by lower production, sixth, higher exploration expenses of COP 130 billion mainly due to the recognition of the Moyote dry well in Mexico during February, and lastly, lower income from transportation services and others of COP 58 billion associated with the decrease in the country's production."
