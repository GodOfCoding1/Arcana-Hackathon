    "content": " Q4 revenue of $100 million would have been $7 million higher, or 10% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and full year 2022 revenue of $376 million would have been $31 million higher or 16% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter of 2022 we reported revenue of $100 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year or 10% on a constant currency basis. Turning to revenue by product technology, our access and optical networking revenue represented 88% of total Q4 revenue, or $88 million, and our software and services revenue was 12% of total revenue or $12 million. Revenue from Asia decreased 9% year-over-year to $51 million, as revenue from the region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, and by COVID locked down to disrupted deliveries later in the quarter. For the full year 2022, we had record revenue of $376 million increasing 7% year-over-year. For the first quarter we are guiding revenue to a range of $90 million to $100 million, which equates to 23% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted gross margins of 36% to 38% while continuing to target 40% exiting the year, adjusted operating expenses between $125 million and $135 million as we focus on operational discipline in 2023."
