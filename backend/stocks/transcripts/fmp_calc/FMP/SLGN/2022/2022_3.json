    "content": " Your line is now open. Your line is now open. You think about our prior commentary, we had so much inefficiency and additional costs in our system last year as we were trying to support the market and trying to support our customers and ultimately, consumers getting low cost food into consumers' pantries and into their kitchens that we had -- I'll give you a great example of making cans in California, George and shipping them to the Midwest. And the added benefit on top of what you're seeing in the margin drop-through is we think that we'll be kind of fully recovered on all that cost overrun that we saw last year by the time we exit '22, and we'll be sitting with an inventory level that is rightsized for the business on a go-forward basis. Your line is now open. I think for metal containers we had projected, Adam, that our pet food customers would have gotten their capacity up and running that they've invested and installed sometime in the middle part of the back half of the year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So again, we're early in the process, as you know, and we always talk about we fight for our customers every day and doing our very best to lower the inflationary impacts on the package of a metal container because we do think it's the best, lowest cost, most efficient means of getting food and product to consumers. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But I think as we sit here now, again, with flattish volumes this year with all the challenges we've talked about, there are significant stock-outs as we sit here today across the country in the U.S. at least, where wet pet food is not on the store shelf because the customers -- our customers are not able to get enough product to the system. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
