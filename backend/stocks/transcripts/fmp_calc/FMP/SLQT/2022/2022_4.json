    "content": " And so, we were very deliberate with the plan this year, how could we drive our best marketing sources with our best, most productive agents and that's really what we've outlined in this 30% to 45% policy pullback, year-over-year and we think that certainly will dramatically improve the cash flow profile of our business And again, we're marching towards cash EBITDA breakeven this year. We are controlling the controllables and we certainly think that we can drive better returns in the business and we haven't talked a lot about it on the Q&A here, but the persistency results that we're seeing from a series of actions that we've taken really starting late in third quarter across marketing segmentation to agent retraining to modifications to sales comp to changes in our tech stack."
