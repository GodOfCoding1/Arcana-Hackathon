    "content": " This will also allow us to operate with a more tenured workforce, especially during AEP and OEP, which should positively impact average close rates and agent productivity; cutting back on policy production in the seasonally low periods of the first quarter and fourth quarter, which will preserve cash and lower overall operating costs; and finally, we continue to invest in our health care services business with additional products and services that set the unique needs of our customers and leverage the marketing spend we're already incurring on the distribution side to add additional revenue, most of which should come from products and services that are cash efficient, have quicker breakeven points and add value to the entire health care ecosystem, including our insurance carrier partners, health care providers and more importantly, our customers."
