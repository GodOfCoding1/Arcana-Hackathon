    "content": " It's certainly too early to declare victory, but we observed tangible improvement over the past quarter due to our preliminary actions, which gives us confidence of lower growth returns focused strategy is the best way to capitalize on the significant value opportunity, we still see in Medicare Advantage distribution. Lastly, going forward, we are placing even greater emphasis on the cash flow and profitability of our business, and we are pleased with our early actions to reduce costs as part of our developed plan that should yield over $200 million of cost savings, excluding SelectRx. For instance, layering in more and more refined customer targeting based upon revised data sets and optimizations of our marketing sources aided in our conversion rates in the third quarter and we believe that we will eventually see observable improvements and persistency with these customers over the long-term. I think it's important, though, to be very, very clear that leaving the guidance unchanged is not a signal about the fourth quarter performance, and there were no sort of onetime benefits in the third quarter that the trends that we're seeing so far in the fourth quarter are not meaningfully different than what we saw in the third quarter. And I think last just to comment some of the things that we did in regards to retraining, which Tim spoke about earlier, with our agents themselves and making sure that they were really up to speed on the benefits, the benefits of this year's plans also made a significant difference in being able to convert the raw marketing material. So, 80% is variable and the biggest piece of that is marketing, but there's obviously agent cost reduction there just based on the pullback that we're expecting next year year-over-year for policy production and then corresponding fulfillment as well."
