    "content": " For the fiscal second quarter, our strategy produced excellent results, specifically a 64% year-over-year growth in consolidated revenue and a $228 million year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, or $83 million excluding the negative adjustment for LTD taken in fiscal 2022. While a favorable AEP helped everyone this year, the major achievement in our senior EBITDA and margin expansion was driven more by our strategy to deploy a higher mix of tenured agents and supply them with more targeted, high quality leads - unit economics and cash flow over growth, to put it simply. Lastly, as Tim mentioned, we will balance the growth opportunity with profitability in the near term but remain confident in approaching breakeven on adjusted EBITDA by fiscal year end, which positions us very well for healthcare services to be a more meaningful contributor to profit and cash efficiency in fiscal 2024."
