    "content": " The data compares favorably to TEPEZZA on each key endpoint, including proptosis response rate, overall response, change in Clinical Activity Score, or CAS, proportion of patients achieving a CAS of 0 or 1 and resolution of diplopia. This cohort like the 10-milligram per kilogram cohort for which we announced data in August, enrolled eight patients, six randomized to receive two infusions of VRDN-001, three weeks apart, two patients randomized to receive placebo. To put the VRDN-001 proptosis response in context, we can compare it to the mean change from baseline proptosis for Tepezza at week six in their Phase 2 and 3 trials, which was 1.8 and 1.9 versus 2.04 millimeters for all VRDN-001 treated patients. As you can see, 75% of our subjects were overall responders, nine of 12 patients that has showed a clinically meaningful improvement in proptosis along with at least a two-point reduction of CAS, while only one of the placebo subjects exhibited this combined change. The THRIVE and THRIVE-2 trials will evaluate identical dosing regimens, all with a 24-week primary endpoint, with three study arms first an eight-infusion regimen, matching with TEPEZZA regimens; second, a shorter five infusion regimen, which would allow patients to complete their treatment course in just three months 43% faster than TEPEZZA; and finally, a placebo arm.
