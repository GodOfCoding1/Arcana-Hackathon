    "content": " In summary, our second quarter revenue improved from the first quarter, which highlights our execution capabilities, product strength and  Zepp business management approach even though the macro environment remains challenging with ongoing geographic conflicts and COVID lockdowns. Despite these ongoing headwinds, our Q2 revenue was RMB1.1 billion and in line with guidance, which consists of 42.9% self-branded product sales and 57.1% Xiaomi product sales versus 32.7% of self-branded product sales and 67.3% of Xiaomi products sales in the same period last year. Likewise, as the launches of the new Amazfit Trex 2, the Amazfit Bip 3 and Bip 3 Pro take place towards the end of the second quarter, hence, their boost to self-branded product revenue will only be visible in the second half of the year. Lower gross margin in the second quarter of 2022 resulted from higher outbound freight costs globally, the adverse impact of currency depreciation and the promotions for our previous generation products to prepare for the new product launches. Second quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses were RMB296.4 million, spending on non-GAAP R&D in Q2 2022 was RMB123.3 million, a decrease of 7.4% year-over-year as we reduced the research and development costs by pursuing a smarter and leaner approach. However, I need to caution here because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed also a downtrend on the overall band global market size from Q2 -- the Q2 number we haven't received yet, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received from different sources from IDC and other market intelligence companies, they are all pointing to a 30% to 40% decline of global band sales in the first quarter of this year."
