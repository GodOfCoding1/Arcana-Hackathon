    "content": " Q1 2022 selling and marketing expenses were RMB103.1 million may increase of 13.6% year-over-year, comprising 13.6% of revenue, compared with 7.9% of the revenue for the same period in 2021, mainly due to higher advertising and promotions for self-branded product and the increase of overseas sales personnels to serve the local markets. So the future is still a very fluid picture as you can see that in our guidance, our Q2 number is already much better than our Q1 number and then, we do have high hopes that in Q3 and Q4 together with our new product launches on the whole year level, we should still have at least similar level of the revenue as 2021 or even with a single-digit growth to that extent. So that\u2019s from a seasonality perspective, I think what you would see is that Q1 will be lowest, Q2 gradually improving, and then Q3, Q4 will be the quarters which is going to make the year, and which are also traditionally the high seasons, giving the Prime Day sales as well as the Double 11 and Christmas sales in Q3 and Q4. So what I'm saying is that you would definitely see from a seasonality perspective, also the self-branded products together with the new product launch, which -- there was no -- there was zero in Q1 and there is going to be a few of that in Q2 and then there's going to be a lot of that in Q3, then these effect would definitely push the gross margin of self-branded products up in Q2, and then also gradually going up in Q3 and Q4."
