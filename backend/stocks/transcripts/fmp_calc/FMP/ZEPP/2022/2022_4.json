    "content": " While in Q4, consumer discretionary spending decreased due to macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Against this backdrop, our fourth quarter revenue came in at RMB1.1 billion, down 35.5% year-over-year, primarily due to decreased sales of Mi Band products. Despite macro challenges, our self-branded products showed strong performance during Q4 with 28.5% quarter-over-quarter revenue increase and continued gross margin expansion. Our company's adjusted operating expenses, excluding share based compensation for the fourth quarter of 2022 were RMB277.6 million, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 5.9% and a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 6.1%. On the gross margin, I have mentioned that our gross margin performance, we have seen that there's an increasing trend quarter-by-quarter in 2022 and we expect that I think 2022 Q4, we   with 20.7%. On the cost, operating cost overall, I think I also just mentioned that we have managed to tune the cost down to a level in Q4, whereby if you exclude the severance cost, it stands at RMB270 million per quarter, while by the full-year run rate was 300 million per quarter for 2022. But as you mentioned, we noticed that there's a cost price going down for the ICs in the industry, and I think in the coming quarters, we probably would see that benefit flowing into our gross margin and that will in-turn also increase our gross margin performance even further than what we have mentioned just now."
