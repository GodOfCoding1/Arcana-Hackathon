    "content": " First, higher than expected flight revenue due to a 20% year-over-year increase in flight revenue per live leg driven by a full quarter of the index fuel surcharge and higher average pricing. Sales and marketing expenses were 6.7% of revenue in the quarter, down slightly sequentially, but up as a percentage of revenue year-over-year due to higher commissions related to strong aircraft sales, as well as the addition of Air Partner. But if you think about the revenue impact of that, I think that's really driven by starting to see some of those pricing increases come through as we mentioned earlier, only about 20% of the revenue flight revenue in the third quarter was on that new June pricing basis."
