    "content": " Flight revenue per Live Flight Leg was $13,088 for the quarter, up 12% year-over-year on a reported basis, but up 16% for core Wheels Up, excluding Air Partner, which records revenue on a net rather than gross basis, that growth largely reflects higher pricing and our fuel surcharge, and is a factor of stage length, cabin class and off-peak versus peak flying. The 550-basis-point sequential improvement was driven primarily by better than expected margins from Air Partner, higher asset sales, as well as improved utility and new member growth, offset by lower 3P margins, continued levels in investment and higher fuel prices. I think, we talked about the guidance and the margin rate that we shared for third quarter, what we expect to see is, some of that hired and skillful performance in terms of asset sales, as well as the outperformance that we got from Air Partner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter will likely come back in a bit and will be offset by some of the fuel improvement as a result of the index be in place. So, I think if you think about that going forward, we signaled two things in the prepared remarks we shared earlier, one is that we had a higher in terms of the level of asset sales in the second quarter, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect that to continue at the same levels and also we saw Air Partner outperform and they make -- because of some of the seasonal volatility in their profile it may not continue at the same level, although, we are quite optimistic how strong Air Partner is contributing so far with the short time with us."
