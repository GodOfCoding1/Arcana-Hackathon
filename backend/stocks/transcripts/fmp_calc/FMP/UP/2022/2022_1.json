This marketplace playbook is a proven to structure in many other verticals, and we are relentlessly focused on providing an unparalleled member experience in the air and on the ground, backed by an unwavering commitment to safety. Today, we are a clear leader with a growing base of more than 12,000 active members and well north of $1 billion of annual revenue. We have built an iconic brand in private aviation, and we have forged a strong and unique commercial relationship with Delta Airlines as well as significant brand partnerships that deliver even greater value to our members. We reported revenue exceeding $320 million, again, a record for the first quarter and up almost 25% year-over-year. Active members are 26% higher than a year ago, and our live legs were up 15% year-over-year as we marked the anniversary of the rebound in travel during the pandemic. Prepaid block sales, a great indicator of future demand were exceptionally strong, over $170 million for the quarter and up over 150% year-over-year. Our core member retention continues to be robust, and our core members continue to spend more than $80,000 per year with us on average. As a direct result of those initiatives, our operations improved each month throughout the quarter, and we continue to improve in April. In fact, absent the impact of higher fuel prices during the quarter, our adjusted contribution margin would have improved sequentially in the first quarter. With the benefit of our fuel surcharge, our recent pricing actions and program adjustments and the contribution from Air partner, coupled with our improving operating performance, we believe we are poised to show margin improvement throughout the remainder of the year. Air Partner is a great fit with our growth strategy, giving us an asset-light platform to extend our offering globally and includes attractive adjacent businesses that we can grow over time. Next, we made a strategic minority investment in Tropic Ocean Airways, a leading provider of SemiCaravan splays, which is ideal for last mile service in Florida, the Bahamas and the Caribbean and a great addition to our marketplace. Sustainability is a journey that we have embarked on, and I'm pleased to announce beginning in June that we will fully offset the carbon emissions of our member and customer plans. One quarter into the year, we are moving quickly to invest in our members and in our customers, expand our supply network, further develop our technology-enabled marketplace and capture a much larger overall TAM. Our operations improved steadily over the course of the first quarter, and that trend has continued so far in the second quarter. So with that, let me provide an update on the operating initiatives that I laid out last quarter, where we will continue to direct our energy and resources throughout the year. First, we're focused on improving utility in the near term to pilots and maintenance hiring. We've already hired more than 250 pilots since November, well ahead of the plan we laid out in the third quarter, and we'll continue to focus in this area. These pilots will steadily enter into service as they complete our company-specific training, giving us a strong ongoing pipeline, which will help to drive our fleet utility going forward. Our pilots are some of the most highly trained and dynamic in the industry, and they probably represent our front line with members and customers. Similar to pilots, we have made a concerted effort to hire more maintenance technicians, which accelerated in the first quarter and which we expect will continue to improve throughout the year. This increase in technicians will boost our mobile service unit capacity by over 50% this year, providing faster response time to address unscheduled maintenance at remote airports because we fly to thousands of destinations, this is a critical capability. Although parts availability still remains a challenge for aircraft manufacturers and the broader industry, we're getting smarter about increasing our inventory of the right cards in key areas where limited supply impacts of a return to service times. I'm pleased to report that with our pilot force increasing and maintenance turnaround times improving, our dispatch availability and utility, the number of towers are top flies for revenue each month improved over the course of the quarter and are now operating at the highest levels in over 6 months. Based on what we have learned from running our own fleets and those of over 100 customers provided more than 80 new features to FMS to make fleet management more efficient, especially for loading fleets and for rapidly changing schedules common today. And there are other opportunities to add automation to our marketplace by connecting our internal systems to our customer-facing platforms like the Wheels app, we can provide real-time customer incentives and tries dynamically to drive demand for off-peak flying. This will help us proactively stimulate demand to fill empty repositioning legs and encourage customers with flexibility to change their travel plans, driving higher utility. Our natively built customer data platform is a critical component of improving our customer experience because it gives our account managers and customer service teams, great visibility into our customers' experiences, preferences and intentions in real time. Like UFMs, the new app was redesigned on a modern service-oriented architecture that enables us to regularly add new features and functionality to improve the user experience. -- greatly reducing customer service interactions while simultaneously providing a better customer experience that puts our members in control, coupled with insights from our customer data platform, our app will ultimately help us shape demand by recommending alternative times, dates or even airports that better mesh with available supply."
