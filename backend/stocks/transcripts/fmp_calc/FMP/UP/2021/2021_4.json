    "content": " Our prepaid block sales were well north of $500 million for the fourth quarter of 80% year-over-year, handily beating our previous block sales record, and this leading indicator continues to be strong in the first quarter. As Kenny noted, we are very pleased with our strong revenue growth with fourth quarter revenue growing 64% year-over-year to $345 million, and full year revenue jumping 72% to $1.194 billion. In the fourth quarter, we added 665 net new members with active members growing 31% year-over-year, our core business offerings with their guaranteed availability, and cap rates across all asset classes continue to resonate with customers even as we raise certain cap pricing tiers in November. Switching to aircraft management, our aircraft management revenue grew 69% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and 70% for the full year, driven by higher flight volumes by owners and member charter usage. That includes what we consider normal capital spending of $60 million for purchase aircraft, capitalized software etcetera as well as the $65 million spent for the Textron aircraft purchase in the first quarter, which we view primarily as a financing decision of previously leased and operated aircraft. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less total capital expenditures, including capitalized software is also very strong, coming in at $267 billion for the fourth quarter and $98 million for the full year. Looking at 2022, given the strong demand we are seeing and the visibility provided from the strong prepaid block sales and resulting $935 million of deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021 we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.42 billion for the year."
