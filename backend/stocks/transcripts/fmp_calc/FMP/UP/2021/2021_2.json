    "content": " As I comment about the second quarter, I\u2019d like to do so in the context of providing overview of our revenue model, which is broken down across four main categories: membership; flight; aircraft management; and other. In the first half of 2019, prior to expanding our fleet offering and pre-COVID, our average core and business members spent slightly over $70,000 annualized with us, inclusive of membership revenue, which we believe is less than 50% of their total spend on private aviation, based on our membership survey data. So that\u2019s -- well, I don\u2019t want to say, it\u2019ll be $230 million this quarter -- end of this year, because of the not having a federal excise tax situation, we do expect blocks to come up."
