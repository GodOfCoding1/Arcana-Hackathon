    "content": "  For today's call, we are prioritizing four topics that we think are most important: one, an update on our business performance for the fourth quarter of 2022; two, our objectives for 2023; three, a progress update on our path to EBITDA profitability in 2024; four, our strong cash position at the end of the year. Overall, OpEx was down $5 million sequentially in the quarter, in line with our guidance and consistent with our cost reduction efforts that support our path to positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million, reflective of the sequential decline in revenue. Ellen, your line is open. Ellen, your line is open. I mean, I would say, we expected our member growth to largely track our overall flight revenue, I think as we look at the outlook for 2023, and we think about where we're positioned, we feel good about the foundation that we built over almost $1.6 billion in 2022. And I think, as I commented a little bit on in the prepared remarks, as we go into the second quarter where we have an outlook of a bit of a move up and sequential improvement certainly in revenue versus the first quarter profile, those actions and the things that we've done to reduce the cost base and other things should create real leverage for us that should push up the margins in a meaningful way, in Q2 and beyond as we go through this year."
