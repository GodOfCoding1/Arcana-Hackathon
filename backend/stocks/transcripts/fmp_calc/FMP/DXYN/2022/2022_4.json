    "content": "  Our financial results for the 2022 fiscal year reflected the large unfavorable impact on our inventory costs in the first half of the year, which was due to several primary factors: we had exorbitant price increases imposed on us by our former primary raw material provider, and the cost of converting to the new suppliers impacted our inventory costs as well; extremely high freight rates on imported products in the first half of the year; and we also saw, as most industries did, a higher cost overall as a result of inflation."
