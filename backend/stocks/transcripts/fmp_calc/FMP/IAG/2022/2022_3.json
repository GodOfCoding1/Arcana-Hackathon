    "content": " Financially, the company took a significant step in addressing its funding requirements for the C\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9 Gold project, with the announcement of the sale of our interest in the Rosebel Mine Complex to Zijin Mining for $360 million in cash and $40 million in assumed liability. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $103 million for the quarter and exclude the $74 million after-tax non-cash impairment charge recognized to align the carrying value of the Rosebel cash generating unit with the sales price of the asset as well as the impact of unrealized non-hedged derivatives and foreign exchange losses, mainly due to the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar on the cash balances held in Canadian dollar. The company reported the third quarter net loss of $129.1 million and an adjusted net loss of $13.7 million or $0.03 per share, bringing the adjusted earnings year-to-date to $6.1 million or $0.01 per share. In terms of our financial position, we ended the quarter with approximately $536 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and we had approximately $107 million available under our credit facility after drawing down $380 million year-to-date, and accounting for the letters of credit in the amount of $19.3 million issued under the facility as collateral for certain surety bonds issued as environmental indemnities. As the C\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9 Gold JV requires its joint venture partners to fund in advance two months of future expenditures, and at Essakane, the company uses dividends and intercompany loans to repatriate funds from its operations and the timing of dividends is usually in the second and third quarter of every year. At the end of the third quarter, the remaining attributable spend to complete the construction of the C\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9 Gold project is estimated to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end on October 18th, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Zijin Mining Group to sell its interests in the Rosebel mine for total consideration of $401 million with cash consideration of $360 million and the assumption of $41 million of liabilities related to equipment leases. As of September 30, the company's estimated attributable remaining project spend to complete construction and bring C\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9 Gold into production is $1 billion to $1.1 billion net of leases and working capital. Anita, thanks for the question. Anita, thanks for the question."
