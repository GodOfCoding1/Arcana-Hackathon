    "content": " All-in sustaining cost is expected to be in the range of $1,625 to $1,700 per ounce sold and the increase in all-in sustaining cost in 2023 again as compared to that from continuing operation in 2022 is due to the same reasons as cash cost per ounce sold as well as the impact of an increased ratio of stripping capital to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry, increased ratio of stripping capital to ounces produced at Essakane, particularly in the first half of the year, where we may see cost come in above 2023 guidance only to step down in the second half of the year."
