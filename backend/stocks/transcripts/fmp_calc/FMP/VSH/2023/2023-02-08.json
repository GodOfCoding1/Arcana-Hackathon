Revenues for the fourth quarter were $855 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance, reflecting in part the impact of COVID-related absences at our plants in China, and in part, lower than expected sales to distribution, reflecting the start of an inventory correction. Gross profit was $249.1 million for a margin of 29.1%, compared to 31.3% for the third quarter reflecting lower volumes. CapEx was $153.1 million for the quarter with $101.5 million invested in capacity expansion, primarily in Mexico and bringing the total CapEx for expansion in 2022 to $214.6 million, an increase of 52% compared to 2021. For the first quarter of 2023, revenues are expected to be between $825 million and $865 million, reflecting ongoing inventory correction and stable pricing."
