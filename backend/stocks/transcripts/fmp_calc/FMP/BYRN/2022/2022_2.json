    "content": " That's because revenue in the second quarter of 2021 was unusually high due to a surge in sales after Byrna's product was featured on Fox News' Hannity Show, a nationally syndicated news program on April 3 of that year. In addition to the investment in these growth initiatives, payroll and compensation-related costs for the second quarter were also impacted by a $0.6 million noncash accounting adjustment to reflect a modification of Byrna's long-term equity incentive plans. Last quarter, we stated that we have begun to see a leveling off in Byrna's operating expenses and we further stated that OpEx should remain reasonably constant for the remainder of fiscal year '22, with the only increases coming from onetime charges or the additional variable operating expenses such as credit card fees, Amazon fees, outbound freight, which all increased as revenues increase. The reason that we've seen a significant increase in our OpEx, however, this year versus last year is due primarily to Byrna's investment in the future growth of the company and the hiring of additional staff needed to support these growth initiatives. If we can get 10% of these people, 5 million people to come to the website to buy a box of non-lethal 12-gauge rounds, at the same time, they're going to say, look, they've got a launcher that I could keep in my glove box or they've got a shield that I could buy for my kid going to school or they've got Bad Guy Repellant that I could give to my daughter in college."
