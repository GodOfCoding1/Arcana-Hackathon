    "content": " Operating expenses were $8.3 million in the third quarter, which is up from $6.7 million for the same period one year ago, but is relatively flat in comparison with the past three fiscal quarters. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA measure, which we use as an estimate of cash flow from ongoing operations was a positive $0.3 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $0.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Despite our positive adjusted EBITDA, cash dropped $1.4 million from $25.9 million at the end of the second quarter to $24.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022, that's because inventory increased by $1.9 million from $13.5 million at the end of the second quarter to $15.4 million. And excluding the second quarter of last year, which included $8 million of incremental sales from an unexpected endorsement from Sean Hannity, this quarter sales of $12.4 million set a new record. We've issued revenue guidance of $16 million to $18 million for the quarter, this would be a new record for the company without any exception and compared to the same period of last year would represent 52% growth at the midpoints of the range. Please proceed with your questions. And then just wanted to follow-up also on as SG&A, I realize you're -- I think you said $1.6 million was what you're planning to reduce SG&A by for next year? Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions."
