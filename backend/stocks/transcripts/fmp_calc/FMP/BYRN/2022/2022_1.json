    "content": " We also think, frankly, that if you look at what is the addressable market for Byrna, maybe there\u2019s 10 million adults that would be willing to point a Byrna SD at somebody, at an assailant and pull the trigger, but there\u2019s 50 million or 100 million parents that would be willing to consider putting a Shield in their child\u2019s backpack to save their lives, so we think that the introduction of the Byrna Shield and our ability to organically get in front of parents is going to be a big mover for us in terms of driving people to the website, and a lot of the funds that were up until this point going to billboards and to linear and OTT TV will most likely be repurposed to trying to get the Byrna school safety program front and center and to become part of the discussion in America on school safety."
