And so when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done this a lot in my past, when we build these two assets, now you have a more complete collection of experiences between the Pro Football Hall of Fame, outdoor attractions, indoor gaming, sports betting, different big large scale events, concerts, comedians, sporting events and indoor waterpark."
