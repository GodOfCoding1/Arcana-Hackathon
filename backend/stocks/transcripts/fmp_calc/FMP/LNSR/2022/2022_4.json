    "content": " This, coupled with the opportunity to replicate the experience I described a moment ago of the customer who's converting more patients from standard to a premium laser cataract procedure, thanks to ALLY gives us confidence that we can continue our execution plan to grow our share of the procedure market as we continue our further transition away from legacy technology increase our overall share of the total US installed base, and continue to broaden Ally's presence in the market. Consistent with our third quarter results, and as mentioned on our call last quarter, this decrease was primarily due to the continued softness in procedure volume as well as the transition away from LLS to ALLY manufacturing, which reduced laser inventory availability and constrained our growth. With that said, fourth quarter 2022 revenue was up 32% on a sequential basis as compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven primarily by ALLY system installations and procedure growth in the US and Europe. However, given the traction and demand we saw in the fourth quarter and continue to see, despite strong competitive and macroeconomic headwinds, we expect to return to 20% plus revenue growth in fiscal 2023 as we enter the first full year of ALLY being commercially available in the United States."
