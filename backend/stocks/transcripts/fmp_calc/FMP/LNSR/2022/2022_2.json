    "content": " This volatility is the result of: one, product mix changes due to fewer LLS units available for placement in 2022; raw materials -- two, raw materials, direct labor and overhead for ALLY being charged to R&D expense until May 2022 when it became probable that ALLY would be cleared and the associated timing of that clearance became imminent; and three, supply chain challenges have and will make the manufacturer of the first 15 to 25 ALLY units less efficient and thereby result in a higher cost of sales for these earlier systems."
