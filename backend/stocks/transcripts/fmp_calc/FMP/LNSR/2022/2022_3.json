    "content": " Discussions with the initial group of physicians, including those that are primarily utilized competitive systems, point to ALLY's compact size, significantly decreased procedure times ergonomic efficiencies, adaptability and enhanced preoperative device connectivity as key advantages of the technology as compared to the first-generation devices that currently comprise most of the market. We had a very successful American Academy of Ophthalmology, where we held 75 ALLY demo sessions and at the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, where ALLY was presented and demonstrated for the first time to surgeons outside the U.S. Surgeons are grateful to see a next-generation platform that is specifically designed to address the limitations of first-generation femtosecond laser cataract systems as well as appreciative of our continued investment in advancing the technology with relevant, substantive improvements. If procedure volume was consistent in South Korea with that of Q3 2021, revenue for the third quarter of 2022 would have increased approximately $200,000 or an approximate 2.5% increase in total revenue over Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of South Korea, we had anticipated a flat or small increase in Q3 2022 revenue as compared to Q3 2021 due to the transition of sales from our first-generation LLS system to ALLY in the quarter with the impact of the transition being exacerbated by supply chain production delays. However, as Nick mentioned, U.S. procedure volume increased approximately 9% and Europe contributed a 3% increase in procedures over the third quarter of 2021, partially offsetting the procedure decline in South Korea."
