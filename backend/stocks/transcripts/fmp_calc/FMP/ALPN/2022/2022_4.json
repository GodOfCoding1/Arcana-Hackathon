    "content": " Alpine is off to a strong start in 2023 driven by progress in the development of povetacicept, a potentially best-in-class dual inhibitor of BAFF and APRIL cytokines with a convenient once every four weeks simultaneous dosing regimen that we believe has the potential manifestations with erythematosus, autoimmune inflammatory diseases. I am pleased to announce that we recently achieved a significant milestone for Povetacicept with the initiation of the RUBY-3 basket study, a first patient-based study for the program, it will study Povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis indications including IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and primary membranous nephropathy. We see broad development potential for Povetacicept in multiple indications beyond the basket studies, including our RUBY-2 study systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as neurologic, dermatologic and other rheumatic disease indications."
