And then they\u2019re also looking to us to expand out their offerings around very sticky services, like the announcement that we made this quarter with Arlo, where we started out with web cameras, and we\u2019re now going to enable even the smallest broadband service provider to build out a full home security solution with Arlo, install it into your home, and then ensure that if someone else comes in and offers a lower pipe or a lower price, it doesn\u2019t matter, because you\u2019ve now got all these great services, including securing your home from a web camera, doorbells, locks, all those types of things with your service provider you trust on a daily basis, which means you are never changing. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. But those open up the conversation, which allows us to then really dive into how do we transform that customer\u2019s business because of the fact that we\u2019ve actually built out unique platforms for the subscriber side and on the network side that provide different capabilities for our customers. And then in behind it, you have the sales organization, but I would also say our very mature customer success organization also follows in behind and says, we\u2019re not just going to give you this new technology, these new go-to-markets, these new solutions and leave you alone. Know our customer success organization is going to lean in, give you best practices, help you train your call center, help you train your marketing organization, how help you train your operations organization, and then take those best practices and ensure that you get the most value out of what you\u2019ve invested in as a BSP. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
