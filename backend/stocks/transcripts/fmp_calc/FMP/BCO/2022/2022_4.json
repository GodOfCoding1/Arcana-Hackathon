    "content": " The 12% organic growth rate included double-digit growth in three of our four segments, as well as in our Digital Retail Solutions, ATM Managed Services, and in our valuables management business, Brink's global service. We expect significant improvement in free cash flow generation year-on-year to around 40% conversion of adjusted EBITDA, primarily through profitable growth and working capital improvements. In total, revenue growth of $335 million, and operating profit growth of $80 million delivered an incremental margin of 24%, increasing the all-in operating margin to 12.1%, a 90 basis point improvement over prior year. With the shift to higher margin revenue, continued efficiencies gained through lean initiatives as part of The Brink's Business System and the additional benefits from our restructuring plans, we plan to expand our operating profit margins by approximately 100 basis points in 2023. On a constant currency basis, operating profit grew 34%, adjusted EBITDA was up 18% and up 28% in constant currency with a margin of 20.8%, 170 basis points higher than last year, and the first time in history our quarterly EBITDA margin has exceeded 20%. Fourth quarter EBITDA of $247 million was up $38 million or 18% versus last year, primarily due to the flow through of higher operating profit. Cash interest was $116 million, $10 million higher than last year, primarily due to higher variable interest rates on the 40% of our debt that is floating and higher debt levels. And through efficiencies in the businesses that we have achieved as we shift to AMS and DRS revenue, we expect total CapEx costs to remain below 4% of revenue or approximately $180 million in 2023, as we discussed earlier."
