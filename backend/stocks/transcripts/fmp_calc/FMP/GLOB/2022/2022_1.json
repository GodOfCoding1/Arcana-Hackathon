    "content": " I am Carolina Dolan Chandler, Chief Digital Officer at Globant. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, investors.globant.com. Our speakers today are Martin Migoya, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Juan Urthiague, Chief Financial Officer; Patricia Pomies, Chief Operating Officer; and Diego Tartara, Global Chief Technology Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments on our call today may be deemed forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will report non-IFRS or adjusted measures, which is how we track performance internally and the easiest way to compare Globant to our peers in the industry. I'd now like to turn the call over to Martin Migoya, our CEO. Globant's creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial culture continues to deliver strong results. In Q1, total revenue was $401.4 million, representing 48.6% year-over-year growth and 5.7% quarter-over-quarter growth. Regardless the short-term events in global markets and geopolitics, organizations everywhere need the right technologies to grow. Across all sectors and geographies users need to interact seamlessly with companies at all times, so organizations are eager to leverage all sort of technologies and touch points to deliver superb experiences. At Globant, we have built our capabilities to scale and identify new trends as they arise. Just like we have done with artificial intelligence, augmented reality, the Metaverse or Blockchain technologies, we're confident in our capacity to offer clients the best mix between ideation, innovation, design and engineering. Now, before we move on, I like to say on behalf of the Globant family how shock and sad we are regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even though we don't have operations or clients in either country, we stand with the families affected by this conflict. Now, I would like to share some insights on our plan for the future as we continue to grow our teams of talent. In Latin America, we continue executing on our plans to expand in the region. In Chile, we intend to increase our workforce by 40%. To accommodate such growth, we have recently opened a new office in Santiago. In  one of our largest talent development centers, we have opened our office in the newest high rise building in the city, which we are calling the Globant Tower. Beyond our physical locations, we want to enforce ourselves as the employer of choice for digital moments. For example, our work from anywhere policy aims to provide flexibility for those who want to travel and develop their career at the same time. Last month, we announced our acquisitions of GeneXus, an AI powered low code software solution company. GeneXus is a trusted partner for companies in all regions of the world with over 1,700 organizations using its products. Most importantly, this acquisition is directly addressing a huge trend regarding low-code and no-code software. First Augoor, our augmented coding product that accelerates the coding process. Second MagnifAI, a product that offers automated visual testing to enable better and faster quality assurance in products. Today, the product is already being used by clients such as Rockwell Automation, Disney and Nissan. And finally, we continue to drive the way forward for our Reinvention Studios. With these studios, we are helping our clients as we challenge the way things are done across different industries. Today, I'm pleased to talk about two new Reinvention Studios. Today consumers have many choices in how, where, and even when to pay for their products and services. With the smart payments Reinvention Studio, we leverage Globant's capabilities in AI, UX, analytics, and blockchain to make digital payments simpler, faster and more secure. Today, disruptive technology is constantly changing the world, creating the need for lifelong learning, upskilling and reskilling. With the EdTech studio, we leverage our best experience in the industry to develop personalized learning pathways and provide engaging experiences. Lastly, I would like to share some news about our board of directors. Based in Hong Kong, Andrea has built an extensive career at JPMorgan in business advisory, investment banking and human capital both in Asia Pacific and Latin America. We look forward to her insights as we seek to expand to exciting new growth markets and find even more ways to connect with partners, clients and communities throughout the world. As we look forward, Globant continues to have a strong pipeline across different clients, sectors and regions of the world. For a closer look at our expanding technological offering, I would like to turn it over to Diego Tartara, our CTO. Thanks, Martin, and hello everyone. As Martin mentioned, we have launched two new Reinvention Studios. We uncovered that while 73% of the respondents feel the Metaverse is accessible to them, only 26% of them have experienced it. To read more about this key trend, we invite you to check our Sentinel report sentinel.globant.com. As we expand our digital capabilities, we want to give our clients the right tools and processes to build an organization that is ready to succeed as they digitally transform. Last month, we announced a creation of the digital performance studio to improve output of teams within organizations. In two decades of assembling agile parts, we have learned that not all organizations have the same level of performance and this position to carry out change. In many cases, the leaders who are tasked with fixing this, lack the right information to make the right decisions. This insights help leaders make informed decisions that not only improve performance, but also foster environments that are attractive for top talent. Now, I would like to share with you more about Globant's story told through our work with our clients and our partners. I'm excited to share that our digital payment platform PowerChute part of our Globant X portfolio has recently closed a deal with Spanish venture capital firm, Sevenzonic. Together, we will create a groundbreaking fin-tech solutions set to transform how consumers make payments moving from apps and cards to WhatsApp, the most used platform in Spain. Moreover, we are providing engineering and art services to Improbable, a UK-based Metaverse technology company. This technology allows companies, brands and creators to interact in virtual spaces with less friction. The AI component of this engineer is expected to improve the developer productivity, but as much as 15%. In Latin America, we're working with Mallplaza, a shopping center with 23 sites and part of the Falabella Group, one of the region's largest retailers. Lastly, also in Latin America, we continue to work with the financial services sector, an industry in the middle of a profound transformation. Through its platform, multi-bank operations are centralized into a single platform solution, making transactions more efficient and ensuring in streamline accounting management. Globant is boosting their digital transformation and acceleration program to develop and launch new and disruptive digital products, and capture the market momentum. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Patricia Pomies, our COO. Over the last 12 month, we had 13 accounts that brought in more than $20 million of revenue compared to $8 million from last year. Turning into the geographic distribution of their revenues in Q1, 63.1% of our revenue was from North America, 23.5% from Latin America, 11.1% from EMEA and 2.3% from Asia and Oceania. During our last earning call, I share how we monitor our net promoter score as a metric to determine how our clients view the quality of our service and our overall relationship. We believe in building lasting meaningful, and transformational relations with our partners as we carryout consistent prevention . Over the last 12 month ending in Q1, we had a score of 66, two points above the previous quarter. Our team of Globers keep expanding, we are now 24,504 creative minds. Some of our locations have been growing at unprecedented rates, such as India, where we have increased our headcount by 85.4% year-over-year. However, we believe we are better prepared to adapt the new talent needs as we are constantly reinventing the global experience. Simply put, we want Globant to be the best place to work anywhere in the world. To make this thing reality, we are developing a new internal approach for talent and career management. The new Glober-centric model focuses on what each Glober needs to encourage autonomy, creativity, and teamwork. We simplify processes as all the internal areas, focus on solving any challenges our Globers may have. From career development to onboarding and benefit we embrace a Glober-centric mindset as a reflection of our inverted pyramid or chart where the organization\u2019s primary goal is to achieve both, Glober and client satisfaction. With a diverse approach, we have mapped benefits that go beyond the standard ones and address different needs for different times, such as parental leadership training and counseling. It\u2019s been an ongoing principle of this company to offer opportunities in this industry for talent all over the world, through our BeKind initiative we have put in place different courses and programs that aim to help people join the bloom in IT industry. Today, I am happy to share that we will be granting 15,000 scholarships for people to be training technology. This is in line with our previous run of 5,000 scholarships in the Code Your Future initiative. At the same time, we believe that it\u2019s imperative to inspire the younger generations. We want to transform reality through education and bring the right tools to inform, motivate, and facilitate access to stem careers around the world. Our project inspire aims to help teenagers throughout the world see the endless opportunities that the technology field offers through workshops courses, and much more. In this ranking, we have been named a great place to work in all the countries where we applied such as the United States, Argentina Uruguay, Colombia, India, and Mexico. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We are delighted with our overall results for the first quarter of 2022, as our business continue to show robust momentum. We feel confident in delivering robust levels of growth in the upcoming years, as companies continue investing in digital transformation for their operations. Our adjusted gross profit for the period increased to $158.4 million, representing 39.5% adjusted gross margin compared to $107 million representing 39.6% adjusted gross margin in the first quarter of 2021. Demand and pricing environment continues to be strong, largely offsetting the ongoing inflation in the labor market. In addition, we continue to drive a small though increasing amount of revenues from services, products, and platforms that support breaking revenue and employee growth linearity. Together, this will help us maintain a healthy adjusted operating margin profile and continue making the required investments in the company to seize the attractive market opportunity in front of us. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of the year, totaled $50.8 million representing 12.7% adjusted net income margin compared to $34.2 million representing 12.7% adjusted net income margining for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted diluted EPS for this quarter was $1.19 based on 42.7 million average diluted shares for the quarter compared to $0.83 for the first quarter of 2021, based on 41.2 million average diluted shares for the quarter. Moving on to the balance sheet, our cash, and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, 2022 amounted to $370.1 million. Q2 is expected to improve and during the second half of the year, we forecast a significant free cash flow generation in line with prior years. Now, I would like to talk about our guidance for Q2 and for the full year 2022. Based on current visibility, we expect Q2 2022 revenues to be at least $425.5 million or 39.4% year-over-year growth. Regarding the fuller 2022, we expect revenues to be at least $1,768 million or 36.3% year-over-year growth. For 2022, we expect our adjusted operating margins to be in the 16% to 17% range while we continue to strongly invest in training programs in cutting edge technologies and expand our sales coverage to further develop our business. Finally, we expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be at least $4.94 for the full year 2022, assuming 42.9 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year. As we go to the question-and-answer, sorry, as we go through the question and answer section of this call, I will announce your name. I wanted to ask on the low-code, no-code theme, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about that in the marketplace and of course you guys did the GeneXus acquisition, which you thought was really interesting. It just feels like there\u2019s going to be a change in effort if you believe that low-code, no-code takes off in a better way. So, I guess I\u2019m trying to understand how does application development change from right building the application, as we\u2019re so used to seeing to building the tools, right, that help others build applications on their own. I mean, it\u2019s part of reinventing the industry in which we are. And that product is taking a lot of traction and is gaining really amazing levels of how to document, how to understand code in a different manner and with that, how to help developers to create better code. And we have examples within GeneXus of creating entire core banking systems of 5 million lines of code using kind of a natural way of describing things, dragging and dropping fields and ways of explaining a system what to do. So I believe between GeneXus, between Augoor and MagnifAI, which is our augmented testing initiative, which computer vision help testers to discover, which are the difference that are the prototype and then on the real product that has been developed. And my perspective there is when we talk about reinventing the way this industry has been developing in the past and talking about concrete steps, concrete actions into that initiative. So, yes, okay with low code, I think its augmented engineering. Of course, this is just one more initiative on that vision that we have and we will keep giving more and more steps towards that with Augoor, with MagnifAI, with GeneXus and integrating maybe more roducts in the platform. But, but I would love to head it over to Diego to explain more about that, because this is something that we love. Like Martin said, I mean first one thing I got in touch with GeneXus years ago as a developer and GeneXus at that point had been in the market for another 10 years. And at that point, I remember that there was a discussion about like the low-code/no-code taken over. However given the rapid change in technology, the footprint of low-code/no-code solutions, multi-platform development, development frameworks, et cetera, is growing, is growing fast. GeneXus is a very, very strong and mature platform that allows you not only to create software without coding, but not just to settle with a traditional templateized type of interfaces, but it has evolved and incorporated a very solid, strong design tool into the tool itself, allowing you to create top-notch type of software. So again, GeneXus, I think it's a very strong tool. There will be opportunities for Globant to use this as \u2013 to use it as a baseline for different type of solutions, and that will bring immediate results, but looking further down the road from a strategic standpoint, I think it's amazing. Just the one on the guidance of course, have to ask about guidance question, just with the raise here. So for the year we guided $1.768 billion, which is about 36.3% year-over-year growth of which we estimate around 33.5% organic growth. So I mean, GeneXus is very smoothy, it adds around $5 million for the rest of the year, because the deal is going to close, hopefully in the next two, three weeks. However as Diego and Martin explained, it's very relevant to us. So in summary 36.3% out of which 33%, 33.5% are organic. And for the full year, we are seeing about two percentage points of negative impact coming from FX, primarily due to the Euro and the GDP, which have appreciated significantly relative to the dollar. Given the ongoing geopolitical situations, a lot of your competitors have started to look more aggressively in areas like Latin America and India, India for talent. So I was just wondering if you're seeing any incremental competition for talent in those markets, and if you believe this could lead to elevated wage inflation or attrition in those markets over time. Well, I mean thank you for your question. Well, the last couple of months, of course, I mean, the situation was a little well as Martin mentioned was not very happy for all the world so that was the first thing that we want to say. But yes, I mean, what we have been building, of course, and growing as fast as you see in our numbers and the talent that we are acquiring are from the places in India. And of course, I mean some of the talent that we have, you know that we have a small office in Belarus and we have an office in Romania that is helping continue the situation there. So for us, I mean, keeping the pace in growing the talent, I mean, has been something that, of course, I mean we sustain and we keep to \u2013 we hope that we are going to continue sustaining for the rest of the quarter. So in terms of wage inflation yes, definitely we will see more wage inflation throughout this year. There is competition for talent, pretty much all over the world. Now we believe we have the right culture, the right projects, the right value proposition for people to continue joining our company. America is a pretty large continent and it's not about one day to \u2013 one day, we cannot operate more anymore in our place. I mean, you need to have capability and we have the largest capability in the market in Latin America by far. So I believe that even though that competition may look like a challenge to us, it's an opportunity, because everybody's looking into Latin America now, and we are the largest and the biggest with the largest capability in the region. And one more thing, which is we're convincing thousands of newcomers into the industry in Latina America every month. So summarizing to your question, I believe this is an opportunity to us rather than a challenge. And that only strength our positioning as leaders in the region, having the largest capability and the largest reach in terms of cities, amount of employees and capabilities to recruit and to go deeper into other places as we're doing now. So one of our core pillars for growth is that we want to expand every day into more places in America, but not just in those cities, sorry, in more countries, but also in more cities. Talent, as we have seen during the pandemic. And we have been talking about this for last 10 years at least, 15 years at least talent is everywhere. And the more popular you are, the more \u2013 the closer you are to where that talent is the better. And that's what we have been pitching forever, and now it's happening, so very, very glad to have this opportunity. And as Patricia said, it's very difficult to the moments that we are living in terms of all the things that are happening in Ukraine and Russia, and all the region I think it's very bad. And also just, I guess, touching on attrition in the quarter, it seems like it tipped up a little bit. So I was wondering if there was any areas in terms of countries or skill sets where those concentrated the most, I know in past quarter you said attrition was kind of heightened a little bit in Argentina with some new competitors coming in the space. It continues to be driven by Argentina, primarily where given the macroeconomics. So it's more concentrated, I would say in one country. As for the second part of your question about Belarus, probably I don\u2019t know Pat, if you want take it there. I mean, we move some people from Belarus to Argentina. I mean, we opened that and we have been very close to them trying to explain the situation of course, and giving them the tools to if they want to move, or if they want to continue their career in Globant. As you know, we have this DNA in Globant that is Globant everywhere. Others, I mean are evaluating if they're coming back or probably moving to other places. Of course we have a strong, I mean, we keep the office functioning and open there in Belarus and we are really close there. I mean, we have been opening positions for women, for example, that are now the head of the families in some of those cases. So I think that there's a lot of things and we also opened an office in Poland so we can operate there and we can, of course be near some people that just want to move or find opportunities near the places they live. We have around 200 people\n Yes only in Belarus, but they're really important for us, their families that are really important for Globant of course. Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations on the results. And I just think that's a very big opportunity for that type of acquisition, expanding that product to a much wider or much better set of clients. And I also wanted to congratulate Patricia on your recent award for COOs congratulations, but those will be my two questions. I mean I feel very honored because this is a team building thing and being, of course, I mean, voted by some other peers. And about GeneXus, I think I'll let Diego to explain. So with regards to GeneXus, definitely, we have actually many plans in terms of how to \u2013 how's the go-to-market for GeneXus. The existing model, you probably know is they use partners and for creating solutions and they say the GeneXus used to sell the tool as a solution, and that was the way it was commercialized. And definitely, what you mentioned about going to blue-chip company is one of them. With regards to YPF, they started actually a long time ago. YPF, by the way, is the largest oil and gas producer in Argentina. And as part of that job, besides creating the app, that was the second largest wallet in Argentina in terms of transaction, is much more. So actually, it's very central to the value proposition today. And they had a \u2013 if you go through their KPIs, the ones we set as part of our success, cost reduction, improvement in the NPS, et cetera, we've just rock it like I don't know, 100% increase in the members of the reward system, 80% growth on their active users, 60% of their payments go through in the gas stations, go through the wallet. So actually, YPF is, yes, they bear big time a long time ago, but it's actually paying off as a business has been very profitable. I believe that the long-term demand for our services and, in general, for any kind of digital transformation efforts are still intact. And companies will need to keep on doing what they are doing now, which is basically transforming, reinventing their businesses and that trend will keep on going. And that trend \u2013 no matter which analysts you see, all of them are forecasting like huge trends in growth of this market so on and so forth. Now what could happen in the short term with those kind of companies needing to pay more money for interest rates instead of paying that same money for digital transformation, we don't know. But what I can tell you is what I already said in my initial statement, which was our pipeline looks great bigger than ever. And I want to be very concrete here, which is there's still a need to do things in a different way, which we bring to the market and other competitors don't. So I believe that here, there is a trend \u2013 there's a very clear trend going towards the industry. Also, there's a very clear trend going to companies that are reinventing this space. Well, more businesses are trying to see how they do the same thing they have been doing in the past in a different way and we're playing that. Of course, for us, it's a day-to-day fight, explaining what we do different to our customers, to the industry to whatever. So I believe those two things will be pretty much independent from any interest rates \u2013 rate \u2013 sorry, increase. How important it will be M&A, specifically in the next 12 months, right. Well, the percentage of inorganic growth is \u2013 Juan can address that. But I would tell you that impact on our valuation is absolutely reflecting an impact that will go slower into the private market valuation, which will lead to opportunities, which we are already seeing them. The first one being geographical expansion and figuring out how to expand faster in Europe, how to expand faster in Asia, how to expand faster in Latin America. The second, which is how we keep on adding things into augmented engineering concept, as I was saying before, how we keep on adding things into augmented coding or GeneXus-like things or platforms in general. So that's another way avenue of acquisitions that, by the way, there's some interesting things happening there because valuations of private companies, even public companies on the software side has been changing a little bit, and that's an interesting opportunity. And then, of course, the customer side, I mean, any specific acquisition on things that we don't do yet or we want to improve like we have been doing with some companies who occur in Spain, with many other things. So I see here like those three avenues in a very healthy way and also seeing opportunities \u2013 concrete opportunities given valuations changing, which, in essence, they are very tactic because I don't think it's a long-term thing. But yes, it's very tactic thing, and it's a moment to pay attention to those things and take quick action and decisions. I mean, again, as always, Globant is an organic growth play. We \u2013 this quarter of the 48.6%, a little bit over 43% was actually organic. So for the full year number out of the 36.3% that we guided, roughly 33%, 33.5% are organic. So mostly, we continue to see strong momentum in organic business. And as Martin was saying, we will always complement our offering with organic \u2013 with inorganic strategic deals as we have been doing in the past. I guess when I think about the guide and the sequential growth, can you help me understand if you would argue that it's a little bit weaker than . So it continues to be on the same range, a slight increase from 35% to 36.3%. On the quarter, what we see this year is a more stable quarter-over-quarter growth. And when you do the math, you will see an acceleration in Q3, which always happens given the number of days and all that. Q2 has April, which is a month where there is a lot of holidays, and that has some seasonal impact, especially in April. Because 36% for the year, of which 33% are organic is significantly above pre-pandemic levels when we used to grow 22%, 23% plus inorganic. So we are talking about 10 percentage points above the pre-COVID level, which is, I think, very solid growth, especially given the current environment and where we are. And I definitely believe that the long-term demand given how companies changed their needs, how people changed their behavior to live in a more digital world. When you look at how big we are in Europe, you can see an enormous opportunity over there. When you look at Asia, which is pretty much nonexistent for us, that's another opportunity. So I think we have more ability  in Q3, sorry, which typically happens for us and then slightly lower than Q3 quarter-over-quarter growth. But all in all, you're going to see kind of all the quarters between 5.5% and, let's say, 7% quarter-over-quarter growth, at least that's what we are seeing as of now. And then as my follow-up question, this was just more of a help me understand, I heard something about fintech relationship with the venture capital firm products. Is there something different that's being done here versus when you build applications for, let's say, the London project, Apple Watch and so forth that was you guys building your own product. I mean, I don't know how familiar you are with PagoChat. But PagoChat is a platform that is based on any conversational interface to be able to create digital accounts to sent money to create like a fintech solution, which is our answer to some of the future trends in terms of conversational interfaces. And together with that development of the platform, we got approached by a fund in Spain that wanted to use that technology to create like a final solution, like a solution for customers. So we partnered with them to bring the technology, all right. We will get paid for that technology, and they will do the whole equity play, like creating the final solution that the creating the payment solution in Spain, so they are doing everything they need to do to make it happen. We maintain something very, very clear for us, which is we always are technology providers. We do not intend to compete with any of our customers in the sector and we won't do it, but we're providing, in this case, we're providing technology to whomever wants that technology and we are allowed to do it. I know it's relatively small and from our perspective, this is where we could see some slow down, or maybe some weakness down the road. Yes, I forgot the first part already \u2013 nice place \u2013 we got distracted by the trees. I mean, our operation in Europe is much stronger than before, but still very small. So I see very concrete opportunities there, some M&A opportunities who are taking a look at. And again, I don't see the effect that you are describing in terms of maybe something happens there, but still the need for digital transformation for every company is absolutely there. So I don't know what can happen, but I believe that Europe will be strong for us. And the growth that will get in Europe during this year will be very strong, as we will show in the numbers. So I don't know if something very strange happens, more strange that already happen. Maybe you can have another discussion around that, but for how things are going right now, I believe that growth there will be very strong and the M&A activity will keep on being as strong as we have done in the past. Let me compliment delivery on that one, so most of our exposure as of now is in the UK and Spain. But I think that, maybe even if Europe as a whole or as a continent grows slowly than the rest of the world, the fact that we are a very small player, it's around 10% of our business over there, gives us the opportunity to win by just, because we are small. We have also, as Martin said we have been looking and we have done a few deals in the past and we have invested organically in building the team. So I think we should start seeing, very good growth coming from Europe as well. On the second part of India, India right now is the third largest development center for Globant. We have been expanding very, very aggressively it's fully integrated to the company. The same way as Colombia, the same way as Mexico, by the way Colombia now is larger than Argentina for this quarter. That's why you start to see places like India, just competing with Argentina, competing with, the rest of the countries not competing. I mean, we work together in the same projects, but you're going to see it in the middle of everywhere. And I think, we have a strong presence in Pune. It's around 16% and we do see India, getting to 20%, 25% in the next few years. It's around, it's 20%\n Much appreciated. It's \u2013 I think question \u2013 short version is yes, and a much longer version would be, we're seeing that demand happening as we speak. And on the other side, our recruiting engine and training engine and all the capacity engine in general is absolutely ready to take over, all those pieces of demand at the speed they are coming. And then, on the second part of your question, we can, of course we have room in the utilization, utilization was around 79.6% for Q1 that gives us around two to four percentage points of additional utilization we have done in the past. So there is some room there, but I mean, we don't need that. I mean, we can also take on those additional deals by expanding our headcount. I think utilization is one of the levers that is also there to eventually help us offset some of the cost pressure that we may have, which as we discussed before, it's there. And the follow up for us is on lapses, which is the cyber breach that took place at the end of Q1. So on the, on Q1, there was no impact because, the event happened I think it was the last, the day before the last of the quarter. And then on Q2, there is some immaterial very, very small impact that is, that happened during the month of April. So the, regarding the current status, and then what happened as you probably know, about a six week ago, we received a cyber attack that was lapses claim as the, the one executing that attack. We evaluated the extent of the attack by the time we finished our first round, we identified that approximately about 1% of our clients have been exposed to some extent, some information meaning some documentation and source code. For the most part, that information given, the places and the servers they got access to was outdated or deprecated. We connected with every client, both the ones being affected and the ones that weren't affected within a couple of weeks. We have restored our normal operation for the most part like, 99% of our operation was restored within a couple of weeks. As of today, only one small client has partially gone back to operation. We have a lot of learnings, but I can say that after this episode, we're, we proved to be quite prepared. We had a, lots of opportunities for improvement here and there, but in terms of us being prepared as a company, I think we passed the test. Congratulations on the strong first quarter, a couple from me. First up on pricing, margins certainly held up in the quarter. And the, also that there'll be a sufficient magnitude to offset sustained inflation. So as you pointed out, during Q1, we had a solid \u2013 we had solid margins and not only in Q1, but over the last, over the last five quarters, we have seen good level of margins and we were able to offset all the cost increases that started to happen early last year. We have increased our revenue per head, roughly 13% year-over-year. And that basically was the main driver for us offsetting, the cost increases. We will continue to have price negotiations, price talks with our customers, the current inflationary environment clearly calls for those discussions and customers live in the same world where we live. So they also know that there is some cost inflation there, and we will \u2013 I mean, we will continue to have those conversations. And hopefully, again we target to maintain margins in the historical 38% to 40% gross margin. But we believe that we should be able to stay within the range, even in this inflationary environment. So I think, part of this has been addressed in terms of our demand. So with regards to digital transformation and the efforts of the company, the one thing that I can say that has changed from last year to this year is if you see our pipeline, maybe the time it takes to, closer deals from the beginning of the opportunity has extended a little bit compared to last year, but the appetite for digital transformation moving from legacy to digital is stronger than ever. So and we expect that trend, even with the current economical situation and geopolitical situation, we continue to see that very solid, very stable, so no headwinds there. Thank you everyone for participating today, and thank you for joining us and looking forward to keep talking and let's stay in contact soon."
