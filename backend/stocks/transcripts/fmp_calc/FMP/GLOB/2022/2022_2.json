Despite salary increases taking place in our key markets during this quarter, adjusted gross margin was pretty much flat year-over-year, a reflection of the positive pricing dynamics that we continue to see in the market and our focus on profitable growth. Regarding the full year 2022, given the overall outlook and market conditions, we are increasing our revenue guidance this quarter and we now expect full year revenues to be at least $1.775 billion, representing 36.8% year-over-year growth of which we estimate 34 percentage points of organic growth.
