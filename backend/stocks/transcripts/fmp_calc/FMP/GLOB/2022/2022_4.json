    "content": " In these first 20 years, Globers has become a growth vehicle and a center for knowledge, deep expertise and nonstop growth mindset, reflecting on the past three years, including the unparalleled impact of the pandemic, it's remarkable to see that Globant has grown our top line by almost 3 times and has welcomed a similarly increase in our employee base. We ended 2022 on a high note with 37.3% year-over-year growth, the second highest annual growth rate in revenues since becoming a publicly listed company while delivering another strong year of profitability and cash generation. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Clearly, the -- whatever we are seeing for Q1 in terms of revenues and in terms of margins, we mentioned 15% to 16% because as we have a slight decrease in revenues, we have like negative operating leverage and that is having an impact on the full year number. Your line is open. I had a question on the -- just overall like bill rate increases that you've seen over the last couple of years, maybe it was 10%, 15%, you're saying it's maybe low to mid-single digits. Your line is open. But again, these projects that we already spoke about, plus the fact that, as we know, we launched our new market, which is basically MENA plus APAC region recently, being the World Cup played in MENA, I think it was great also to make a lot of connections into a region that is going to be investing heavily in technology over the next few years. Your line is open."
