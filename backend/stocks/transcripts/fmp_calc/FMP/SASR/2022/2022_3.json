    "content": " Today we reported net income of $33.6 million or $0.75 per diluted common share for the quarter ended September 30, compared to net income of $57 million or $1.20 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2021 and $54.8 million or $1.21 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Looking at earnings through another lens, pre-tax, pre-provision income for the quarter was $64.1 million, a 6% increase after adjusting the linked quarter $76.2 million for the $16.7 million gain on the sale of the insurance agency and $1.1 million in related M&A expenses. The net interest margin for the current quarter at 3.53% was 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter, but we ended the quarter with more in the low 340\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as funding costs continued to increase at a greater pace than earning asset yields due to the impact of the two most recent fed increases on short term rates. We have successfully executed on our strategy to hold a larger percentage of mortgage production on the balance sheet and regrow this asset class, and we have achieved our current desired level for mortgage loans held in the portfolio, which grew 4.7% compared to the linked quarter and we do not intend to further grow this asset class in the near future. Non-interest expense for the current quarter increased $2.6 million or 4% compared to the prior year quarter, and this was driven by a $1.5 million increase in compensation expense and $1.4 million in other non-interest expense. I think I speak a little bit to your question as it relates to kind of the pipeline going forward compared to what we've done going in the past Catherine, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously come out of the cycle where it's been largely fixed rate production that we've seen over the last few quarters."
