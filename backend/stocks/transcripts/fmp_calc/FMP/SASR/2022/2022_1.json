    "content": " Today, we reported net income of $43.9 million, which is $0.96 per diluted common share for the quarter ended March 31, compared to net income of $75.5 million or a $0.58 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2021 and $45.4 million or $0.99 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses was $1.6 million, compared to the prior year\u2019s quarters\u2019 credit of $34.7 million. During the first quarter of 2022, funded commercial loan production increased to $545 million or by 90% compared to $288 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Looking at PPP at the end of the quarter, we had outstanding loans of $75 million compared to over $1 billion in the prior year quarter and remaining fees to be earned total $1.7 million. And the allowance for credit losses was at $110.6 million or 1.09% of outstanding loans and 239% of non-performing loans, compared to $109.1 million or 1.1% of outstanding loans and 224% of non-performing loans at the end of the prior quarter. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Your line is now open. Erik, Dan, if you look back over the past four quarters, including this quarter end, I think with the exception of quarter \u2013 end of the third quarter, we were about $1.5 billion going into at quarter end in the commercial pipeline. And that\u2019s \u2013 that is \u2013 from our perspective, pretty exceptional given the fact that the first quarter, if you go back many, many years has traditionally been a pretty soft quarter in terms of commercial loan production and growth. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Hey, good afternoon, everyone."
