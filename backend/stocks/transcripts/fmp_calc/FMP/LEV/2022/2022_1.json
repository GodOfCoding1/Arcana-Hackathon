    "content": " And third, the movement towards transport electrification continues to gain strong momentum as demonstrated by unprecedented government funding packages announced in the US and Canada, including the announcement last week of the first $500 million in funding under the EPA's $5 billion clean school bus program. Also, in addition to last year's announcement by the City of New York, that it will electrify 100% of its school bus lead by 2035, New York Governor, Hochul, recently announced that the State of New York will look to follow the same path and commit $1 billion to support EV adoption and infrastructure. We posted revenues of $22.6 million in Q1 up $16.4 million as compared to $6.2 million last year and were pleased to deliver 84 vehicles at 72 buses and 12 trucks, a significant increase as compared to the 24 vehicles delivered in the same period last year. Benoit, your line is open. And when we're saying we're making millions of investments in our manufacturing capacity, and this is obviously hitting the gross margin, while in Q1, but that's going to keep, hitting the gross margin for the next quarter as well. Benoit, your line is open."
