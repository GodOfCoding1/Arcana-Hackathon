    "content": " Because after all those years of working so hard on those trucks like, for example, the Lion5 and the Lion8 tractor, well finally, I mean, we're launching them this year. I mean, when you're selling electric vehicles, I mean, that's part of the challenge, and that's one of the reason we have this agreement with Mitsubishi and NGS as well because we feel that they can -- they need to finance their product. I mean the BMS is really state of the art, the battery management system, but also the BTMS, the thermal management system, state-of-the-art, fully custom made to the Lion batteries as well and the users that we're doing with the Lion trucks and Lion buses."
