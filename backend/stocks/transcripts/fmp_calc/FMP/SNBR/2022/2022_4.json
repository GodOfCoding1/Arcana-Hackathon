Full year EPS of $1.60 reflects a 3% net sales decline, a 350 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate and operating expense deleverage from the sales decline. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect net sales to be flat to up low single digits versus the same quarter last year and expect to deliver approximately 90,000 smart bed units. It had really strong demand for it during the fourth quarter and several of those units are sitting in our backlog, as we enter '23 and we look for those units along with a full year of Climate 360 sales benefiting our gross margin rate for the year. Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much. But first of all, let me just start with, hey, we expect improvement this year of at least 150 basis points and both the easiness of commodity costs as well as having the even flow of chip inventory so that we don't have the stops and starts in our delivery time frame and also not using the air freight and the expensive broker markets that we've had to these past couple of years."
