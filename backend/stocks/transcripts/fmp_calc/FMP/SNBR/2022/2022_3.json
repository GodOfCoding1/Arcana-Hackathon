    "content": " Third quarter net sales were $541 million, a decline of 16% from 2021 because of constrained supply of semiconductor chips and consumer sentiment were near record lows. Over time, we expect to drive demand and margin with our game changing new innovations claw back about 30% of the $160 million to $170 million of annualized input cost pressures and the more efficient through our move to 100% fully preassembled beds and level loaded operations enabled by improved chip supply and flow. Operating expenses of $290 million were down $27 million versus the prior year and 60 basis points better than forecast as a percent of net sales, while observing unfavorable customer financing costs and less efficient media. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. As Shelly highlighted, the innovations we're launching right now with the Climate 360, the new platform that supports our new 360 beds next year, those set the stage for some pretty incredible health and wellness opportunities as we go into the future as well, which will help us drive even better operating profit rates going forward."
