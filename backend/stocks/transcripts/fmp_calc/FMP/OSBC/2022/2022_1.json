    "content": " Nonperforming loans decreased $6.7 million, compared to the prior quarter with upgrades of various credits and payoffs of others. We recorded net charge-offs of $293,000 in the first quarter, compared to $4.7 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to two large credits last quarter one in commercial from legacy Old Second and one in commercial real estate from legacy West Suburban. The allowance for credit losses totaled $44.3 million at the end of the quarter, which is 1.3% of total loans, which is consistent with the total ACL as of December 31, 2021. At quarter end, $320,000 of provision for credit losses on loans that was recorded, which was offset by a like total reversal of reserves for unfunded commitments based on a review of line utilization trends. Noninterest income increased from last quarter with an increase of $1.5 million due to MSR, market gains, card-related income, increased growth of $583,000 and service charges on deposits of $466,000. We are pleased with how credit has performed with credit metrics improving and a number of credits that I would be concerned about having been resolved favorably, as noted with our $8.1 million decline in classified assets this quarter. Your line is live. Your line is live. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Please pose your question. Please pose your question. Your line is live. Please pose your question. Your line is live. So total accretable mark of $9 million recorded on loans, the accretion in December was $540,000, PAA income in Q1 2022 total was $2.4 million that should be relatively stable."
