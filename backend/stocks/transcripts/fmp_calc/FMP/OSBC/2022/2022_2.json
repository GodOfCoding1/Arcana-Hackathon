    "content": " Net income adjusted to exclude West Suburban acquisition-related costs, and net gains from branch sales was $13.8 million or $0.31 per share in the second quarter. Earnings in the quarter were favorably impacted by an increase in net interest income of $4 million, but offset by a minimal MSR valuation mark-to-market gain compared to last quarter's MSR mark-to-market gain of $3 million and net losses on mortgages sold due to the sharp increase in interest rates. We had $222.7 million or 6.6% of net loan growth quarter over quarter, or approximately $230 million exclusive of PPP runoff. The allowance for credit losses totaled $45.4 million at the end of the second quarter, which is 1.3% of total loans, which is consistent with the total ACL as of March 31. At quarter end, $1.3 million of provision for credit losses was recorded, which was offset by an $800,000 reduction of reserves for unfunded commitments based on a review of line utilization trends. Noninterest income decreased from last quarter with a decrease of $2.9 million quarter-over-quarter and MSR mark-to-market gains as well as net losses on residential loans sold of $262,000, obviously, a very disappointing quarter in residential lending. Provision for credit losses on loans of approximately $1.3 million were recorded during the quarter, and our economic outlook slightly -- declined slightly quarter-over-quarter with an unemployment rate projection increasing to approximately 4% to 5.5% through June 30, 2023, and over the remaining life of the loans. It's tough to know what's going to happen, but I would say it's likely that you're going to see us carrying $100 million to $200 million and received fixed swap position on the loan portfolio as we talk next quarter. Thinking back on this, it wasn't that long ago when we were getting questions about what we were going to do with all the excess capital, and we were reporting a 10% TCE ratio, but that included a $50 million to $60 million positive mark on the bond portfolio."
