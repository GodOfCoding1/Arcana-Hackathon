    "content": " Net income adjusted to exclude West Suburban acquisition-related costs, net losses from branch sales and gains from the sale of our VISA portfolio and land trust portfolio was $19.6 million or $0.43 per share in the third quarter. The margin benefit resulted from balance sheet mix improvement, the impact of rising rates on the variable portion of the loan portfolio and strong loan growth for both the second and third quarter. The allowance for credit losses increased to $48.8 million as of September 30 from $45.4 million at the previous quarter, which is 1.26% of the total loans and consistent with total ACL to gross loans as of June 30. At quarter end, $3.5 million of provision for credit losses on loans was recorded as well as $973,000 of provision for unfunded commitments, and increases were driven by loan growth and are based on a review of line utilization trends. A gain on the sale of our VISA credit card portfolio of $743,000 and a gain on the sale of our land trust book of business of $180,000 were recorded in the third quarter. Noninterest income increased from last quarter by $2.3 million, driven by a $1.1 million net increase in mortgage banking, including an increase of $711,000 in net gain on sale of mortgage loans and a $466,000 increase in the fair value of MSRs."
