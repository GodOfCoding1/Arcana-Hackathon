    "content": " Revenue in Q1 grew 57% to $47.2 million, up from $30 million last year in 2021. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by one, higher views across our content channels; two, stronger monetization across both web and video platforms; three, growth in our direct sales channels and four, continued growth in subscriptions; five and lastly, growth from the Addicting Games and U.GG properties. Gross profit grew to $13.5 million in Q1, up 127% from $5.9 million this time last year. Notably, Q1 gross profit was also within 1.5% of Q4 2021 gross profit, which was $13.7 million despite the seasonal effects, which typically make Q4 strong in Q1 week. On a year-over-year basis, the 880 basis point improvement is driven by the increase in direct sales, the increase in subscription and the increase \u2013 the acquisitions, including most notably as mentioned earlier, very strong performances by Addicting Games and U.GG in Q1, both of which are high margin businesses with strong growth curves."
