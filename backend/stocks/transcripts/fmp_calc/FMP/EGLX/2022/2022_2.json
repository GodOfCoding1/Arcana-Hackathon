    "content": " Q2 2022 was impressive, with revenue up 38% year-over-year to $51.1 million. Q2 subscription revenue was an all-time record high of $3.5 million, up 73% from $2 million in Q2 last year. Q2 esports and entertainment revenue was $2.2 million, up 41% from $1.5 million in Q2 last year. Gross profit reached an all-time high of $15.3 million in Q2, up 91% from $8 million in Q2 last year. The drivers of the strong gross profit are unsurprising, being direct sales of $9.3 million, subscription revenue of $3.5 million and the continued strong performance of Addicting Games and U.GG. The path to a 30% gross margin also provides a glimpse into the future P&L of the company, for example, year-over-year in Q2, we added $14 million of revenue."
