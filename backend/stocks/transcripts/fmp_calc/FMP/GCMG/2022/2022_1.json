    "content": " You can see on Slide 9 from the first quarter of 2021, our firm's share of carry and net asset value grew by $234 million or 129% and our investments also grew, increasing by $56 million or 61%. With the extreme levels of volatility today, it's hard to project short-term ARS business or investment results, but with flat returns and some modest outflows from May through December 22, our ARS management fees this year would end up roughly in line with fees in 2021. Fee related revenue increased by 10% over the first quarter of '21, driven by the fundraising success that we've enjoyed over the past year. Private markets management fees were $46.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% from the first quarter of '21, inclusive of $1 million of catch-up management fees. Importantly, adjusting for the impact of catch-up management fees in the fourth quarter, private markets management fees grew by $1 million or 2% on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting the continued strength in that business. Absolute Return strategies management fees were $42.7 million in the quarter, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of '21. Fee-related earnings compensation in the quarter was $40.9 million, slightly higher than the fourth quarter as we anticipated, but relatively flat compared to the first quarter of last year."
