    "content": " We entered into the third quarter with confidence that our second half fundraising would exceed first half fundraising, and at our private markets fee related revenues, excluding catch up management fees, would continue to grow at double-digit rates. In the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of catch up management fees in either period, we expect organic growth in private markets management fees to be 10% to 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. And I think you're not -- you need to see the environment generally become a bit more stable before you might see increases in general macro demand in this environment where people don't have a problem, they are pleased to not have a problem, but nobody is really rushing forward with much in the way of new investment anywhere in the alts space right now, and I think we need that macro environment to settle down a little bit. And I think that when you think about the valuations that are implicit on ARS, you think about the performance of ARS and then you think about traditional asset management firms where revenues are down dramatically because of markets and where there's not a positive inflow environment, and hasn't been for quite some time, I just think you've got a real mismatch on the way people see the value of that vertical."
