    "content": " Over the two-year period, our private markets business has seen a meaningful mix shift with secondaries and co-investment assets growing as a percentage of private markets AUM from 39% to 47%. For Q3 '22 compared to Q3 '21, excluding the impact of catch-up management fees, we expect private markets management fee growth of 15% to 20% will drive overall fee-related revenue growth of 3% to 5% with an FRE margin of around 35%. Our mix shift to higher fee activities is driving private markets management fees at 18% growth versus private market POM growth of 13%, and our new channels are working well for us and growing at rates well in excess of their current percentage of our AUM. These investment types now represent $22 billion or 47% of our private markets AUM compared to $13 billion or 39% just two years ago, a 31% compound annual growth rate. To that point, and as illustrated on Slide 11, our private markets fee paying AUM has grown by a 13% CAGR over the past two years, whereas the associated management fees grew by an 18% CAGR. Private markets management fees were $50 million in the quarter, an increase of 19% from the second quarter of '21. I'm trying to square the circle a little bit in that we see fundraising of -- in private markets, we see fundraising of around $2 billion, and the fee-paying AUM were up $900 million, and then the contracted, not yet fee-paying AUM was up around $200 million, if I'm doing my math right."
