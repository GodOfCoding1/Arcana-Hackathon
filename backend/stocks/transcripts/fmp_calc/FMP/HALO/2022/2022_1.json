    "content": " We reported first quarter revenues of $117.3 million, a 32% year-over-year increase resulting in GAAP Q1 2022 earnings per share of $0.43 and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.47. Based on the strong momentum, we project continued royalty revenue growth in 2022 with growth of approximately 50% to approximately $300 million. During the first quarter 2022, Janssen's parent Johnson & Johnson reported worldwide sales of DARZALEX including both the IV and subcutaneous forms of $1.856 billion which was up 40.3% year-over-year on an operational basis. These priorities are to invest to maximize our ENHANZE revenue growth and durability, to continue to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and at the center of the slide to seek to acquire a platform technology, where Halozyme can operationalize and create additional value while also adding to and further extending our revenue durability. In 2027 and beyond, we expect Antares' multiple growth drivers will be highly additive coming in the form of its growing to sell strong, replacement product business, revenues from partner products and new partnerships with companies seeking subcutaneous administration for both small and large molecule products. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect total revenues of $530 million to $560 million, representing growth of 20% to 26% over 2021 total revenue. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.
