    "content": " As a result, we are not changing any of our expectations on our key strategic objectives, being having DREAM 12-month clinical data available in the fall of 2023, resulting in regulatory approval before 2020 summer; implanting our ACCESS patients this quarter and achieving German leadership by the end of the year. So, today, our focus is on getting the last five implants done, having the clock starts ticking, getting regulatory approval somewhere in quarter two 2024, and then before, making sure that we do all the proactive activity needed to build a team already started by market access people and also by investing in hiring of sales leadership."
