    "content": " As a reminder, our 3 key strategic priorities for this year are: completing the U.S. DREAM pivotal trial; accelerating commercial execution in Germany; and commencing of ACCCESS U.S. IDE study for complete concentric collapse, or CCC, patients before year-end. From a reimbursement perspective, we continue to make great progress implanting patients in Switzerland and Finland, and we continue our discussions with local healthcare authorities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and the U.K. We are also pleased to see the growth in complete concentric collapse patients now receiving Genio implants since these patients previously had no suitable treatment option other than major palate surgery and were contraindicated to commercially available hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy. What we do see, however, is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also getting CCC patients after the dice examination that were identified to be implanted with the unilateral stimulation, and that is definitely also accelerating and helping us further growing our business in Germany. Now to that extent, the way we have built our team in Germany and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also thinking of using as a commercial approach when we will be able to enter the U.S. commercially is that we will make sure that there is the high-quality field clinical engineers supporting the ENT surgeons when doing an implant and when activating patients."
