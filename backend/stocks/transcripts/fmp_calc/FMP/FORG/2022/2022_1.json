    "content": " We ran a like-for-light comparison, and if we did the same dollars of new SaaS ARR in Q1 2022, that we did in Q1 2021 with the difference made up with self-managed ARR, we estimate our total revenue growth would've been approximately 30% year-over-year or approximately $5 million of impact. Using the same analysis that I described earlier, if we did the same dollars of new SaaS ARR in Q1 2022, that we did in Q1 2021, with the difference made up with self-managed ARR, we estimate the impact to revenue would be approximately a positive $5 million delta, resulting in an operating margin that would've been approximately negative 8%. Total revenue of $212 million to $215 million, representing 21% year-over-year growth at the midpoint; non-GAAP operating loss of $32 million to $28 million, representing an operating margin range of negative 15% to negative 13%; and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.45 to $0.41, assuming weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 84.8 million."
