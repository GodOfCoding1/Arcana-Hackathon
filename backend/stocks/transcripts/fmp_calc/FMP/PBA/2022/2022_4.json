    "content": " Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by lower margins on NGL sales, partially offset by higher margins on crude oil sales, both in the Marketing & New Ventures business, lower contribution from Aux Sable, a lower contribution from Ruby, lower revenue related to recoverable costs on the Horizon Pipeline system, higher general and administrative expense largely due to higher long-term incentive costs, driven by the change in Pembina's share price and its share price performance relative to a peer group as well as higher consulting fees and higher integrity costs."
