    "date": "2022-11-04 12:54:03",
    "content": "  Relative to the prior period, the third quarter was positively impacted by stronger marketing results due to higher margins on crude oil and natural gas sales, and a higher share of profit from Aux Sable, partially offset by lower NGL margins as a result of lower propane prices and higher input natural gas prices; likewise, a combination of higher volumes on the Peace Pipeline system and higher inflation-adjusted tolls, a higher contribution from Alliance Pipeline, higher contribution from the PGI assets and a lower realized loss on commodity-related derivatives."
