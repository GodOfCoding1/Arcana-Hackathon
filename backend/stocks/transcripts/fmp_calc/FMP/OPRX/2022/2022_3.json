He is joined by company Chief Financial and Operating Officer, Ed Stelmakh; Chief Commercial Officer, Steve Silvestro; General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Marion Odence-Ford; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Andrew D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Silva. At the conclusion of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings call, I will provide some important cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. Now with that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to OptimizeRx CEO, William Febbo. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and as a result, we are maintaining our guidance for the year. For example, the bandwidth issues at the FDA, which impacted novel new drug approvals this year, appear to be improving with the majority of vacant positions having been backfilled and the FDA increasing the rate of approvals over the last 2 months. Furthermore, while the great resignation increased average employee turnover across the life science industry, which resulted in substantial changes with key decision-makers, the rate of turnover appears to be solid and should eventually return to normalized levels. Finally, we mentioned longer sales cycles tied to our shift towards participating in larger, more complex programs with our pharma clients. As a reminder, these AI-enabled, real-world evidence deals represent multimillion dollar per brand opportunities and offer OPRX significant scalability. The closing of these deals naturally takes longer to complete, given the increased number of stakeholders involved at the customer level. Despite these factors, we are seeing significant momentum off the midyear trough that we believe should materially benefit the company in 2023. For example, we recently won two new real world evidence contracts with top 20 pharma clients during the fourth quarter and have multimillion dollar annual contract values. In addition, we renewed one of the first two RWE contracts we launched in 2021 and that client expanded its scope to an additional indication and is interested in further expanding across multiple oncology brands. With pharma manufacturers moving a greater percentage of their commercial spend toward omnichannel digital solutions while looking for those solutions to deliver more impactful results by not only identifying patients known to HCPs, but also pinpointing new patients for the therapies. We believe smarter solutions, such as OptimizeRx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RWE, will capture the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of the pharma spend, particularly with legacy commercial dollars that are reallocated to digital. With that said, we expect we will have at least 6 RWE deals running during the first half of 2023, with many more in the hopper and believe just executing on the RWE opportunity we have in front of us today would position us to grow our top line by over 20% in 2023. Meanwhile, on the product side, we continue to drive significant value creation on behalf of our customers, helping them increase the ROI seen by their commercial teams by providing unique physician and consumer platforms and strategies, which help patients afford adhere to their treatment regimens. Through the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to real-world data, our RWE solution was able to accurately predict ATPs with at-risk patients in real time and the results speak for themselves as the program drove more than 200% growth over the manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial number of HCPs identified with at-risk patients. Over 46,000 incremental scripts among HCPs receiving affordability information and financial resources for their patients and more than 6:1 ROI on the manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investment in the program, while 27% of the HCPs identified and targeted for the affordability information program enrolled a patient for the first time. In a different case study for another top 20 manufacturer, which analyzed results over a 12-month period, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our RWE solution in identifying patients that require specialty therapy within a very narrow timeframe from diagnosis. With our proprietary technology, we are able to collect, sort and make sense of information to directly identify providers who would likely have a patient suitable for this therapy and notify those providers of those patients in a timely and efficient way. We delivered extraordinary results for our manufacturing partner, while reducing the complexity in the care delivery system for healthcare providers and their patients. Meanwhile, we continue to strengthen our channel network and recently renewed our exclusive partnership with NewCrop, which is now a subsidiary of Therapy Brands and a leading electronic prescribing service trusted by hundreds of EHRs nationwide. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we continue to be at the nexus of a significant systemic shift within the life science industry, where a substantial portion of pharma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing commercial spend, is expected to rapidly migrate to sophisticated strong ROI solutions. And with that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to our CFO and COO, Ed Stelmakh, who will walk us through the financial details for Q3. As with all our calls, the press release was issued with the results of our third quarter ended September 30, 2022. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2022, our reported revenue for the period was $15.1 million, a decrease of 6% over the $16.1 million from the same period in 2021. Gross margin for the quarter increased from 56.3% in the year ago period to 62.4% in the quarter ending September 30, 2022 due to a favorable solution and network partner mix. As we highlighted in the previous earning calls, we have seen an increase in the percentage of activity flowing through channels with more favorable economics when compared to a year ago. Given our performance in the third quarter of 2022, we are reiterating our guidance, which calls for revenue to come in between $62 million and $68 million for the year and gross margin between 59% and 62%. Increase in expense is primarily due to the investment in and expansion of the OptimizeRx team to enable future growth, which also includes our April acquisition of EvinceMed. Providing more color around our year-over-year increase in OpEx, nearly three quarters of the $4.1 million total increase was tied to non-cash expenses with the remaining amount being primarily related to the EvinceMed acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately $1.3 million or $0.07 per fully diluted share as compared to non-GAAP net income of approximately $1.6 million or $0.09 per fully diluted share in the same year ago period. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $78.8 million as of September 30, 2022 as compared to $87.4 million as of June 30, 2022. The sequential decline in our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was tied to our buyback. As a reminder, we announced a $20 million share repurchase program during the second quarter. And during the third quarter, we have bought back 693,000 shares for $12.2 million at an average price of $17.66. In total, we have purchased 1.1 million shares year-to-date at an average price of $16.70 per share and have 1.5 million remaining for repurchase under the buyback program. This amounts to nearly 6% reduction in our shares outstanding, which now stands at $17.2 million, which we view as a positive outcome for our shareholders. However, as a company in a market that is active with merger and acquisition activity, we may have opportunities such as for acquisitions or strategic partner relationships, which may require additional capital. Now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s KPIs to be introduced this past February to provide transparency as well as quantifiable metrics that can be used to continue to communicate our story as our business grows and matures. This is largely due to the delay in the renewal of one of our initial RWE contracts that Will referenced in his prepared remarks and the addition of 1 new top 20 manufacturer over the last 12 months, which is still very early in their lifecycle with us. We continue to maintain a meaningful presence with 19 of the top 20 largest pharma companies, which represents the better part of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial spend. Our third quarter of 2022 net revenue retention came in at 96%, a reduction versus the second quarter of 2022, driven by this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lower revenue growth. Meanwhile, our operating model continues to demonstrate significant capability for leveragable growth with revenue per full-time employee at $619,000 for the third quarter of 2022. We continue to stay ahead of the technology industry packed average of approximately $500,000 per FTE, further demonstrating the strength of our operating model. Your line is open. First one from us, just curious if you could talk a little bit just how things are going with your channel partners. Yes, channel is a big piece of our business. Obviously, we have done a lot of work on this over the years. And I think if you put the two together, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got real staying power because we all know there is of friction and fragmentation in this market for our clients, for doctors and patients, so very focused. Really starting 2 years ago, we are looking at the specialty therapeutic areas, because the marketing spend is clearly shifting that way, done a great job reaching the major pockets. And we also realized that as pharma is looking for partners that are both technology and strategy, we also are looking outside the EHR and looking at what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling omni-channel. And our end goal over the next few years is to be able to get the right information to physicians, to help patients anywhere they are digitally. And that will positively impact the business, it will help us grab more budget dollars and we will certainly continue to drive improvement in gross margin. In the short-term, the mix has really been a combination of new partnerships as well as solution mix, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given a great result. And then I guess just a quick follow-up, curious how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about sort of the visibility into the rest of the year. And so if I look at the midpoint of the guidance, it implies a pretty decent sequential growth rate for fourth quarter. So I would say if you look at the full year guidance we gave, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably at about 95% confidence level, achieving the midpoint at this point. But as you know, Q4 does typically have a seasonal ramp up as compared to the previous quarters. I think our differentiator inside of Q4, which sets us up really nice for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 is this RWE solution because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that has proven itself in terms of measurement in finding additional HCPs and patients. It was really early last year, and we had measured it. Your line is open. Will, on the RWE offerings, you mentioned two deals signed already in Q4. When we think about contribution from those \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the original two, you mentioned renewing now are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they were very large dollar amounts. Yes, that was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we said they are all multimillion dollar, and we view those in 6-month increments, so multimillion times two. Obviously, the headwinds got in our way a little bit this year on just keeping one of those flowing through the second half of the year, which obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the revenue. And the new ones, while they are not quite as big as those others, they are still very significant. And when you put the two together, it certainly helps gross margin given the architectural fees and such that are part of that solution. So not giving you a specific range, but they are all significant and what really is helpful in our shift as a business away from completely tactical, which obviously gives you less site long-term site of revenue. is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just stickier and programmatic, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really at a much higher level within the client base. And so you put all that together and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to help us continually get more mature, as Ed likes to say, as a business when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting predictability of revenue, but also inside the relationship with the client. Yes, I mean in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 really in the second half of the year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of last year, beginning of this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen several smaller kind of adjacent competitors coming in with small pieces of networks, really limited reach, but overpromising. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encouraging is that we are now in the second half of this year, all of those impact analyses are coming due. And so we are seeing an influx of clients basically coming back saying, hey, we ran a program with fill in the blank. But basically, all of those smaller overpromising, underdelivering competitors that have claimed to have network access are now being somewhat outed in the market, which I think is good for us because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a really strong bedrock based network with a decent moat around it, as you know. And we just continue to deliver as Will has stated and you heard him just say it again, really solid return on investment for our clients and so feeling really confident in that in terms of competitive landscape. Your line is open. So our business even next year will still have a healthy degree of tactical and media purchasing, so it does not imply that, that alone will drive growth. And again, we have a closed network, which no one else has, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary and advance of really strong CPMs. We view them all as clients, and we think that will secure and grow the tactical part. And then the RWE on top of that is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beefier, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more consistent. And frankly, that the white space in the market allows as well as these headwinds getting out of our way. At this stage, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still relatively early in the quarter in a quarter where every day is pretty active. And just one last one, just on the retention, so we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it sounds like in your prepared remarks that, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being negatively impacted by the renewal of that RWE. Obviously, we got four quarters looking back right now captured in that number, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really driving that number to what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing now. So my hope is if our projections come true, we should start to see that number recover sometime next year. I would just add to that, David, that I think we are going to see follow-on effect from the client base. And the more and more we have conversations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we mentioned two new clients getting in on this pipeline is very healthy, so yes. Your line is open. So the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all our business is with pharma, right, 100% of it. But pharma relies heavily on agencies in three ways, media, content and strategy. And so we have relationships with over 50 agencies because ultimately, once a client has decided to work with us, we then work directly with the agencies to make it all work to make sure the content is compliant and works. The strategy when it comes to things like RWE and other areas of challenge for our clients and then obviously, media spend, which is more tactical and also plays really nicely into our omni-channel approach now. But ultimately, our sales force is directly focused on the clients and then working with those agencies that facilitate that relationship. Specifically, you mentioned nations are happening in 4Q. Just taking the last one first, not really talking to buy-ups, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a little too early to get into that. However, it is a good time to get those newer clients set up for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break out the percentage, but just as a range, they can be anywhere from $0.5 million to $1.5 million in terms of the setup, and we generally get that done over a three months period of time. And then it moves to just distributions, which is like most of our business, but at a higher CPM. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 relative to the RWE pipeline, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break it out. But I think we are leaning on it pretty heavy to make sure the message is out there that, that will be a growth driver on top of the tactical work. No, I think you covered it, and I think all your comments have covered it well. Your line is open. It looks like a pretty wide range, $19 million to $25 million roughly. And just curious, you talked about 95% kind of there already. We feel the headwinds we expressed in Q2, Q3, we obviously were saying they are subsiding, but they are still around. As Ed said, we have 90% viewed today, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very early in November. So, I think that should give people confidence that we should be able to do that and fully focused on it as a team. It would be decisions by the clients moving a little faster, buy-ups coming in that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about yet, that kind of thing. If you just look at the logs, you will see that, clearly, they have staffed back and the backlog is getting worked through. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just remind everyone that, that means that those brands, which are probably in areas that we are focused in, will get approved and have to go-to-market, and therefore, we will kick into gear helping those clients. Your line is open. Revenue from customers outside of the pharma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top 20 was the best level, it looks like in at least the last seven quarters. So, I think really what you are seeing is just a factor of the cadence that Will highlighted on the prepared remarks. So, basically, one of our larger customers with the RWE renewal resulted in just the numbers kind of looking a little weird in the third quarter. So, effectively because they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there, from a percentage of revenue standpoint, make some of the smaller customers seem higher. And once those kick in, it should bring back \u00e2\u0080\u0093 come back nicely. Well, if you just think of the dollars that are out there for sales reps, conferences, speaking bureaus, all that good stuff. And I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifting now based on what Steve said, around measurement and you have got to actually support what you said, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting harder for smaller companies, whereas ROI year-over-year just goes up given the solutions that we have around helping patients start and stay on therapy. So, I think you are going to see that continue, and the dollars are going to be efficiently spent and the ROI is going to be strong enough that I think the CAGR of spend will continue to be really attractive in this space despite the economy and sort of some macro headwinds. In the release, you talked about the RWE could drive 20% growth next year. And then kind of how does \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how do you think about the growth rate in other parts of the business relative to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you previously had talked about kind of 30% growth was achievable kind of at the end of last year, early this year. Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is a lot of pieces to that question. But I think, ultimately, as we said, tactical, we feel like we have set the wheels in motion to grab that business and grow it. And you put those two together and you are just more relevant to your clients, which means you will capture more shares because the budgets are all bigger on the digital side. So, we feel like we have got all those lined up. Once again, thank you everyone for joining us on our update call this afternoon. We are maintaining our focus on product execution to continue to deliver superior ROIs on behalf of our customers, which has and will continue to pay dividends as we execute against the opportunity within the vast white space that we continue to sell into. Our core strategic imperatives and operating strategies have not changed, and we will expand upon our innovative solution set, which address the needs of our customers while improving care for HCPs and patients. We are fully confident in our best-in-class platform offerings, while our growing point-of-care network remains unrivaled, creating a significant competitive moat around our business. As a result, our domain expertise in bridging the digital communication gap in healthcare in order to improve medication awareness, access, adherence and affordability remain unsurpassed. Finally, we built a business that is capable of driving across various economic backdrops. Meanwhile, large pharma, our largest customer base, did very well throughout the pandemic and their balance sheets remain extremely healthy, and we are continuing to move more and more spend to digital solutions. So, outside the three factors that I highlighted earlier, we should be more insulated from broader macro factors than most industries, particularly as the FDA and pharma workforce turnover issues work to us out . We want to actually thank our employees, shareholders, customers and partners alike as we continue to build out our solution on one unified omnichannel platform.
