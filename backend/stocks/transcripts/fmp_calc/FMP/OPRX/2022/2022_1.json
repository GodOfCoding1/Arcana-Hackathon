    "content": " As we forge ahead, our operating strategy continues to center around three basic tenets of growth, which are having the right team at the helm to execute our initiatives, the remaining focused on enhancing our solutions and digital enablement capabilities and offering increasing strategic value to our clients. Our average revenue per  manufacturer grew year-over-year by 20% to $2.5 million in 2022 despite adding two new top 20 customers over the last 12 months, which are still early in the relationship life cycle with us. Our operating model continues to demonstrate significant capability for leverageable growth with revenues per full-time employee at $733,000 for the first quarter of 2022, which represents a 16% year-over-year improvement on what was already an industry-leading metric and a testament to the team we have built in our ability to act nimbly in an ever evolving macro environment."
