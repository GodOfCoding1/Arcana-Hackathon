    "content": " While we saw an expected slowdown in sales, we continue to prudently manage our spending and deliver on our cost-efficiency initiatives through delivering operating income of $0.4 million for the quarter or 0.4% of revenue, which was also above our guidance range of negative 3.5% to 0%. From a profit perspective, in the first-quarter the company delivered operating income of $0.4 million or 0.4% of sales, which was better than our guidance range of negative 3.5% to 0% for the quarter. Looking-forward, guidance for second-quarter sales is between $87 million and $97 million, while our first-quarter results were better than guidance, we feel that based on the glut of retail inventory our customers will continue to pull-back on orders or in-stock products, giving us reasons to believe the second quarter will be at a similar or declining level to that of the first-quarter. We intend to prudently control SG&A costs and expect SG&A costs between $14.5 million and $15.5 million in the second quarter, which is slightly higher than the first-quarter as we begin to prudently invest in our growth initiatives discussed by Derek."
