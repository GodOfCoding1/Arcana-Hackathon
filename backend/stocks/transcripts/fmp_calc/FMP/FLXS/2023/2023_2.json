    "content": " I am encouraged by the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives and ability to gain share in the market, allowing us to deliver sales for the quarter of $93.1 million, which was in the range of our guidance as our growth initiatives helped to partially offset the challenges posed by high retail inventories and waning consumer demand. For the second quarter, net sales were $93.1 million, down approximately $48.6 million or 34.3% compared to $141.7 million in the prior year period. From a profit perspective, in the second quarter, the company delivered operating income of $3.8 million or adjusted operating income of $1.0 million or 1.0% of sales, which was within our guidance range of negative 1.5% to positive 1.5% for the quarter. We intend to prudently control SG&A costs and expect SG&A costs between $15 million and $16 million in the third quarter, which is higher than the second quarter as we are actively investing in our growth initiatives discussed by Derek. Yes, I won't comment to the quarter, but we have provided guidance in the past and in our current forecast for all of our incremental growth initiatives is between $30 million and $40 million of revenue in the full fiscal year."
