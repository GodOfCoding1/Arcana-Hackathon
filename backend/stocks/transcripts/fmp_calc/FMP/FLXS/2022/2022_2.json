    "content": " Second quarter net sales were $141.7 million, up $22.6 million, or 18.9%, compared to $119.1 million in the prior year period. Our sales results were at the high end of our revised $137 million to $143 million guidance range, despite the ongoing supply chain issues faced in the quarter, which Jerry highlighted earlier. Although growth was flat in comparison to a strong prior year quarter, sales improved by $5 million, or 38%, compared to first quarter results. Consistent with that guidance, we reported a fiscal second quarter net loss of $7.5 million or a negative $1.13 per diluted share that compared to net income of $8.5 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. The primary driver of the year-over-year decline in both net income and gross margin percentage is higher ancillary costs associated with ocean containers, which as Jerry explained, exceeded $15 million in the quarter. Looking forward, guidance for the third quarter sales is between $135 million and $145 million, which translates to sales growth between 14% and 22% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year 2022, we are still targeting sales growth between 15% to 20%, but achievement of that growth will be dependent on global supply chain conditions and the impact of rising cost inflation in the second half of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the company anticipates spending $10.5 million to $12.5 million for capital expenditures, of which a large portion will be spent in the fourth quarter related to equipment for our new production facility in Mexicali, Mexico."
