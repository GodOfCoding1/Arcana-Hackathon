    "content": " While near-term sales will likely be strained for the next three to six months, due to slowing consumer demand and bloated retail inventories were staying on the offense and aggressively pursuing opportunities to gain share in our existing markets, but as important to enter new growing markets where we believe we can provide differentiated solutions and have a right to win. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $124.5 million, down $11.7 million or 8.6%, compared to $136.2 million in the prior year period, while down from the prior year, our sales results were within our $120 million to $135 million guidance range provided during our third quarter earnings call. While we have and will continue to take steps to adjust our costs, in line with lower sales levels, we are protecting strategic investments that we feel are critical support our long-term growth ambitions, namely our investments in the new Mexicali manufacturing facility and new Northeast D.C. As such, we are projecting operating income as a percentage of sales in the range of negative 3.5% to 0% for the first quarter with the largest drivers of variability in the range being sales demand and competitive pricing conditions. So again, a big part of our growth strategy is going after new markets, new consumers, new products, and we've invested fairly heavily around product development here this past year and I think we'll start to see the fruits here in fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823."
