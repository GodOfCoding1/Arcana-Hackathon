    "content": " First quarter net sales were $137.7 million, up $32.5 million or 30.8% compared to $105.2 million in the prior year period. From a profit perspective, we reported a fiscal first quarter net income of $4.35 million or $0.61 per diluted share that compared to net income of $3.89 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Excluding these items, the company reported adjusted net income of $3.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share as compared to net income of $6.3 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses increased $4.6 million to $18.8 million compared to $14.2 million in the prior year quarter when we aggressively reduced costs in response to COVID-19 and related sales declines. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is expected to be in the range of 26% to 27%, inventory levels may increase modestly in the second quarter as we continue to invest strategically to improve in-stock service levels and provide exceptional support to our customers, but working capital is expected to be a source of cash flow in the second half of the year."
