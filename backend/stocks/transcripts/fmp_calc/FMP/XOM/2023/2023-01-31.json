    "content": " If we look at 2012, when we had extremely -- our last -- higher revenues than we've got today, we made more money this year with less revenues and that's really a function of the improvement in net profit margin, where we went from about 10% net profit margin in 2012 to 14% in 2022. In the Chemical business, it's really around focused on performance project -- products and making sure that we're leveraging our technology to develop products that have a high value to customers and therefore a higher margin. And if you think about security of supply and counting on your partner to say sequester carbon for 100 plus years, I think you're going to want somebody who's been around for a while and knows how to do that. I think the most important thing, though, is to actually take a step back and look at the full year results because what we've told you during the year is, look, we're going to have these price timing impacts, especially mark-to-market on open derivative, positions are going to move around quarter-to-quarter and during the year."
