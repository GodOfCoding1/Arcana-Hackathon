    "content": " And then you mentioned Golden Pass, which is an important leg of our strategy of making sure that we have access to LNG supplies that we can -- to supply/demand all around the world, and that's a very important part of our strategy in LNG going forward is making sure that we've got barrels that we can then move and trade in the marketplace and move across the different regional demand centers. And so I think that's something that we're going to see for quite some time, certainly here this year and into next, depending on obviously work how demand plays out. And based on where we're at and where the revenues are, and I would also tell you, though, that it's not what's not going to change is being very focused on making sure that any investment that we make is advantaged across the cycle. And then the final point I would make there is obviously, with what's happening in Ukraine, there is a wildcard there that I think most economies and governments around the world are going to make sure that they're trying to mitigate the potential implications of that supply disruption by having good inventory levels. I would say while we're in a very tight market today, we're not going to let that distract us from our focus of making sure that we have low cost of supply, industry-leading advantaged projects. In the short-cycle stuff, I think to the extent that we stay within our credibly advantaged approach and the manufacturing processes that we've set in and the boundaries that we set with respect to the facilities that we've built, we pre-invested in and we'll continue to optimize around that, but we're not going to go outside of that broader strategy of the long ball game that we're playing in the Permian, in the interventional space."
