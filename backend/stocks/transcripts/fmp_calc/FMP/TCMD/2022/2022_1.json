    "content": " Our total -- our 2022 total revenue guidance reflects sales of our lymphedema products increasing approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year and sales of our Airway Clearance products in the range of $19.5 million to $20.5 million For modelling purposes, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 million to $16 million in 2022. Specifically, we expect total revenue growth of approximately 10% to 15% year-over-year driven by flat to 3% growth in our sales of our lymphedema products and $5 million to $6 million of sales of our airway clearance products, which as a reminder, did not impact our sales results in the second quarter of 2021."
