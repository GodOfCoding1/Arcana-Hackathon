    "content": " Our updated 2022 total revenue guidance range assumes sales of our lymphedema products in the range of $207 million to $209 million, representing growth of 2.5% at the midpoint of the range, consistent with the growth expectations in our prior guidance range, which also points to growth in the second half of 2022 in the mid single-digits and sales of our airway clearance products in the range of approximately $35 million to $36 million. For modeling purposes, for the full year 2022 we expect gross margins in the 71% to 72% range, our GAAP operating expenses to increase 26% to 28% year-over-year, compared to 23% to 24% previously, the higher expected growth in our-GAAP operating expense for this year is driven primarily by non-cash, intangible amortization and earn-out expense of $3.3 million in Q3 and approximately $500,000 of executive transition and legal expenses, neither of which were contemplated in our prior guidance ranges."
