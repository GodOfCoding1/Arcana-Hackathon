    "content": " Our updated 2022 total revenue guidance range assumes sales of our lymphedema products increased approximately 3% year-over-year, which reflects growth in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year in the second half of 2022; sales of our airway clearance products in the range of approximately $30 million to $32 million. Specifically we expect total revenue growth of approximately 13% to 17% year-over-year driven by 1% to 3% growth in sales of our lymphedema products, and $7 million to $8 million of sales in our airway clearance products."
