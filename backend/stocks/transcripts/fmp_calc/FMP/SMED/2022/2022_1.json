Professional market billings were negatively impacted in the current quarter by first about a $100,000 decrease in billings for route-based services to lab customers as COVID-19-related volume decreased compared to last year. And over a $100,000 lower billings for route-based services to customers or hazardous waste activity that's been delayed until the December 2021 quarter due to nationwide sporadic and temporary moratoriums on accepting hazardous waste streams destined for third party incineration. Within this retail market, immunization-related orders grew 9% to $1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $1.6 million in the prior year.
