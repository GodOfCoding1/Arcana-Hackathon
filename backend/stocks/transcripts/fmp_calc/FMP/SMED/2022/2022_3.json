    "content": " Retail market billings decreased 79% to $4.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to $21.7 million in the same prior year period, reflecting returns to more normalized activity following the surge in immunization activity that occurred in March 2021 quarter related to demand for the COVID-19 vaccine. Long-term care billings decreased 10% or to $0.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $1 million in the prior year period, related primarily to heightened volume of COVID-19 related waste management in the prior year, most of which impacted the route-based customer billings."
