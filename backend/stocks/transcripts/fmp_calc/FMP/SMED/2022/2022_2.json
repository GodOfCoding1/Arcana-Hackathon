    "content": " Professional market billings increased 15% to $5.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of last year, consistent with the increase in route-based customer locations that David described earlier. Long Term Care billings decreased by $300,000 to $800,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period. Our billings for unused medications grew 9% to $1.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as compared to $1.7 million in the same prior year period, as a result of a 25% increase in the number of MedSafe liners sold. SG&A increased by about $600,000 or 17% to $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same prior year quarter. Looking forward to the route-based business in the March, 2022 quarter, we expect to see about a 15% or more increase over the prior year March, 2021 quarter, if higher COVID related activity of about $300,000 in Long Term Care and labs in the prior year is excluded.
