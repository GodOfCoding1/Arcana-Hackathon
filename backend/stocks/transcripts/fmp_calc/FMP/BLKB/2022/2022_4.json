    "content": " The business generated strong adjusted free cash flow of $154 million, which exceeded the high end of our full year guidance range and enable debt repayments ahead of schedule. At the midpoint of our full year financial guidance ranges, we anticipate organic revenue growth at constant currency of 4%, consistent with last year. And consistent with our focus on optimizing the business, we expect Rule of 40 at constant currency to expand from 29% last year to 34% this year as we march towards attaining 40%. Against this backdrop, we met or exceeded our full year guidance ranges we gave on our Q2 call for revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted free cash flow. Taken together, Rule of 40 at constant currency of 29% was a 2-point improvement over last year and in line with our full year expectations. Taken together, we are targeting Rule of 40 at constant currency of 34%, a 5-point improvement year-over-year at the midpoint, largely driven by our margin expansion efforts. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow in the range of $170 million to $190 million, approximately 17% growth year-over-year at the midpoint . As a result, we expect 34% at constant currency on a Rule of 40 at the midpoint of our full year guidance ranges, up 5-points versus 2022, giving further confidence in our ability to reach our goal of 40% in the next few years.
