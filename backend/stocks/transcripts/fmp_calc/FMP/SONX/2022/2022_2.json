    "content": " As we sit here almost halfway through the third quarter, we expect to report a meaningful sequential increase in gross margin due to improved operating processes and increasing percentage of procedure instruments converting to CleanFlow and the company benefiting from our third mid-single digit percentage procedure instrument price increase in the last 18 months. As account management responsibilities are absorbed by our consumable reps, we're also starting to see early signs of increased productivity and pipeline generation from our capital reps, who are now fully focused on selling capital equipment to new customers that have a strong pipeline of opportunities as we head into the back half of 2022. As previously mentioned, Sonendo's total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $10.5 million, compared to $8 million for the second quarter of 2021 an increase of 32%. And I think the other thing that to keep in mind, right as we entered the second half here, and as we are continuing to increase the share our total procedures, but to CleanFlow, we're concurrently also getting these consumable reps more up to speed, and productive in the practice."
