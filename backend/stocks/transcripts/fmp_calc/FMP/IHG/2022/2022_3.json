    "content": " Clearly, leisure has been an important factor in our strong quarter three performance with rooms revenue from this driver up 12% on 2019, but business demand saw global rooms revenue down only 8% in the third quarter, whereas it was down 25% back in the first-quarter of the year. As I've mentioned, progress on the recovery across business travel in the US, so rooms revenue get back to flat on 2019 levels for the quarter, whereas it was down 12% back in the first quarter. Your line is now open. First of all, just on what sort of 4% for this year net unit growth, you talked about organic opportunities in the past the company's signed some sort of lumpy business in terms of alliances with casino operators, US Army hotels, but they've been quite low revenue generation. Your line is now open. And then, I guess, on the ISG financing front, then yes as you say, the position we've taken on our corporate debt of keeping that in unhedged sterling has meant that the net debt of the Group has reduced by $400 million over the course of the year with the movements in cable, obviously, the company is highly cash generative and we translate through our EBIT typically to over 100% into cash. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
