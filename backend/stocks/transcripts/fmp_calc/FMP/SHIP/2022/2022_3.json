    "content": " Regarding our financial performance during the third quarter, we recorded net revenues of $34 million and adjusted EBITDA of $19 million, while net income was equal to $7.1 million. Our daily time charter equivalent for the third quarter was about $2,600, representing a premium of over 50% compared to the average Baltic Capsize Index for the period attributed mainly to our freight hedging activities and some profit selling from our scrubbers. Moving on to corporate and financial developments, we continued our reward commitment to our shareholders with the declaration of another regular cash dividend of $0.025 per share for the third quarter with a total cash dividend payout reaching $22.5 million or $0.125 per share over the last four quarters. This reduction reflects the slower Capesize market conditions that prevailed in the third quarter of 2022 as elaborated previously by Stamatis which caused our daily time charter equivalent to decline similarly percentage-wise to $20,614 from $30,764. For the nine-month period, net revenues was $96.5 million compared to $96.4 million in 2021 with increased fleet size compensating for the decline in the time charter equivalent on a year-over-year basis. On a US GAAP basis, earnings per share for the quarter and nine-month period were $0.04 and $0.10, respectively, highlighting our profitable performance under Capesize day rates that we consider to be below historical average or mid-cycle levels."
