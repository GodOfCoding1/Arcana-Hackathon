    "content": " We delivered revenue of $310.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.3% and 14.7% in constant currency. And our adjusted 2022 EBITDA was $256.8 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $58.2 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7% was approximately 120 basis points higher compared to the midpoint of the range I guided to in November. We now have 35 clients with 2022 revenues greater than $10 million, 5 more compared to 2021, a 16.7% increase year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $58.2 million for the fourth quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.7%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $303 million to $305 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of negative 5.5% to negative 5% or negative 2.5% to negative 2% in constant currency. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%, negatively impacted by approximately $8 million of nonrecurring severance-related costs in the quarter. There's definitely signs that despite the macro uncertainty, despite the concerns that the client -- our clients are looking beyond 2023, looking at 2024, they believe that given the macro conditions '24, we're going to likely see much healthier, stronger economic growth, and they are making investments from a growth perspective, from a tech digital perspective, trying to capture that growth. It's not just in sales and marketing capacity, we're investing more in verticals that are, we believe, resilient in this current macro environment, public energy, health care sector, for example, that's now roughly 25% of our global revenue; automotive-s and financial services."
