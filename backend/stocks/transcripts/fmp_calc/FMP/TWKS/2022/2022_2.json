    "content": " We delivered revenue of USD 332 million in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting year-on-year growth of 27.5% and 33.5% in constant currency. As I discussed during our earnings call in May, we expected our Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be impacted by the seasonality of pay rises, a higher level of annual leave or vacation associated with public holiday schedules, public company-related expenses and several in-person demand and marketing events that took place during the second quarter. We now have 33 clients with trailing 12-month revenues greater than $10 million, 8 more than the second quarter of 2021, representing a 32% increase. Adjusted EBITDA was $58.5 million for the second quarter, an increase of 14.2% compared to prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.6%, which is in line with our operating plan, a decrease of 210 basis points compared with the second quarter last year."
