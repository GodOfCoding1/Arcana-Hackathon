    "content": " Just look at the value assessment of over 130 customers we publish on our website that shows on average customers generate 8% revenue uplift, 200 basis points to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 67% efficiency gain. Subscription revenue in the third quarter was $51.8 million up 17% year-over-year, and total revenue was $70.3 million up 12% year-over-year. We expect 2022 subscription revenue to be in the range of $203 million to $203.5 million, a 14% growth rate at the midpoint and total revenue to be in the range of $273.75 million to $274.75 million, a 9% growth rate at the midpoint. First, as we mentioned last quarter and in past earnings announcements, even though the majority of our revenue is generated outside the United States, our foreign denominated ARR is less than 15% of our total ARR, so the foreign exchange impact on ARR and revenue is often less than what the geographic revenue mix might imply. We anticipate subscription revenue to be in the range of $52.1 million to $52.6 million, representing a 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint."
