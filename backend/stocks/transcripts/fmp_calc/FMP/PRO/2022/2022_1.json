    "content": " Now it\u2019s easier than ever for customers to evaluate models like those that optimize margin, revenue or cost to dynamically drive the best outcome for their business across all their sales channels. Subscription revenue in the first quarter was $48.8 million, up 14% year-over-year and total revenue was $66.5 million, up 8% year-over-year both exceeding guidance ranges. And then looking at the other, we\u2019ll call it half of the business a little bit more on the revenue side, obviously today, one of the things that we\u2019ve been picking up over the last quarter or two is an increase in demand for e-commerce, infrastructure and platforms, as customers are looking to sell digitally in new ways through new channels. If you look at the amount of innovation that we\u2019ve done and now also with our acquisition of EveryMundo in the digital fair marketing, we can now power kind of the future of travel digital retail and allow airlines that demand is coming back, not only to ensure they have the best revenue management technology, but be able to really drive more demand to their digital channels and drive a better customer experience."
