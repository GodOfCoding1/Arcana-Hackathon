    "content": " Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter was $53.1 million, increasing 13% year-over-year and exceeding guidance. For the full year, subscription revenue was $204 million, increasing 15% year-over-year. Our strong subscription revenue performance along with a stronger-than-expected services revenue result led to total revenue in the fourth quarter of $70.9 million, increasing 9% year-over-year, and $276.1 million for the full year, increasing 10% year-over-year. We expect subscription ARR of $250 million to $253 million, representing 11% growth year-over-year. We expect full year subscription revenue to be in the range of $230.7 million to $232.7 million, representing 14% growth year-over-year and total revenue to be in the range of $293 million to $296 million, representing 7% growth year-over-year. Turning now to guidance for the first quarter of 2023, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $54 million to $54.5 million, representing an 11% increase year-over-year. But the growth rate of 14%, at the midpoint relative to your kind of 14% or maybe even a little bit higher closer to 15 this year in subscription growth, just considering the momentum throughout the year and obviously travel, you at least sound like you are more confident that it's going to be better this year. Starting with the revenue guidance, can you just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 why only 7% year-over-year growth in fiscal year 2023, given that or fiscal year 2022, you had 13% billings growth."
