    "content": " Second, as Steven just mentioned, the FDA's 510(k) clearance to market EksoNR for use with MS patients not only gives more patients in need the opportunity to rehab using our leading exoskeleton devices, but it also meaningfully expands our total addressable market. Ekso generated second quarter 2022 revenue of $3.5 million compared to $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 57%. During the second quarter of 2022, the company incurred increased expenses related to increased sales and marketing activities and higher research and development expenses due to sustaining engineering activity for the EksoNR and the development of next-generation products. So it's -- from a resourcing perspective, one of the strengths that Ekso has is our great commercial team, including our sales and our clinical teams and as well as our marketing team, and we are basically leveraging those teams and getting them out there to be able to spread the good word of how we can help more patients. Additionally, receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our EksoNR for use in patients with MS not only gives us a greater pool of patient access -- to access but it allows them to have this as part of their rehabilitative solutions."
