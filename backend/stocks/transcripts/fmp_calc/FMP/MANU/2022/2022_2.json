    "content": " And we have achieved our biggest three months for interactions in the first half of this fiscal year, generating over 1 billion digital interactions, a 181% increase relative to the prior year period, designating Manchester United as the number one club or sports team on social media worldwide. Turning to the key items and the results; total commercial revenues were GBP64.4 million, with sponsorship revenues of GBP35.2 million, GBP2.6 million lower than the prior year quarter due to the absence of a training kit partner in the first half of the year, partially offset by global deals. Looking forward to the next fiscal year, as Richard just mentioned, the Premier League is nearing completion of negotiations for the upcoming cycle which we anticipate will result in an approximate 16% overall increase in gross Premier League revenues, driven by a near 30% overall growth in international broadcast rights versus revenues earned in the current cycle."
