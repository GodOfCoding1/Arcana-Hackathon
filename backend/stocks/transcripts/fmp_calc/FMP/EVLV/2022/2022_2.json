    "content": " First, revenue was $9.1 million, up 94% year-over-year, primarily reflecting three drivers: very strong demand in our key vertical markets, including education and health care, an increase in purchased subscription deals and continuing momentum and expansion with our channel partners. ARR at the end of the second quarter was $20.9 million, reflecting growth of 25% sequentially and 181% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was a record $66.2 million at the end of the second quarter, up 31% sequentially and 166% year-over-year. So in total, we had about $81 million of RPO plus contracted revenue in backlog at the end of the second quarter, representing growth of approximately 27% sequentially. Adjusted net loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other onetime items, was $17.3 million compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes stock-based compensation and other onetime items as well, was $16.4 million compared to $5.2 million in the second quarter of last year. We believe we are well positioned to meet our full year growth plans and as such, are reaffirming our previous guidance which calls for full year revenue of between $29 million to $31 million with the year exiting ARR to more than double to $27 million to $28 million."
