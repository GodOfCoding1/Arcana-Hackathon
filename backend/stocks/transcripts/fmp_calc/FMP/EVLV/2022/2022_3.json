    "content": " During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to our current expectations and views of future events, including, but not limited to, statements regarding future operations, growth and financial results, our potential for growth and ability to gain new customers, demand for our products and offerings, and our ability to meet our business outlook. Revenue in the third quarter was $16.5 million, up 96% year-over-year and 82% sequentially, which we believe reflects strong demand in our core markets and continuing momentum with our channel partners. ARR at September 30, 2022 is $28.7 million compared to $9.9 million at September 30, 2021, reflecting growth of 189% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. We're currently modeling full-year revenues next year of between $55 million and 60 million, reflecting growth of about 25% year-over-year. Using the same purchase the pure subscription revenue mix in 2022 that we're currently estimating for 2023, our total revenues would have been approximately $30 million compared to the $46 million to $48 million we are now forecasting. Our outlook for total revenues in 2023 would have been more in the range of approximately $85 million to $95 million, reflecting growth of approximately 100%. We believe we can exit 2023 with ARR of between $65 million to $70 million compared to $31 million to $32 million at the year-end 2022, reflecting growth of more than 100% year-over-year."
