    "content": " Revenue in the fourth quarter was $20.9 million, up 217% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. This compares favorably to our previously issued guidance of $12 million to $14 million Our revenue growth in the fourth quarter continued to be fueled by strong new customer acquisition activity, continued hardware purchase activity, and rapid acceleration in subscriptions. Moving to slide 21, ARR at December 31st, 2022 was $34.1 million compared to $12.9 million at December 31, 2021, reflecting growth of 164% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation, loss on impairments of lease equipment, and certain other one-time expenses were flat sequentially at $19.7 million compared to $19.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted loss, which exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charges, and other one-time items was $18.1 million compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes stock-based compensation and other one-time items was negative $17.8 million compared to negative $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Using the same purchase subscription to pure subscription revenue mix in 2022 that we are currently estimating for 2023, our total revenues would have been approximately $30 million rather than the $55 million we delivered last year. Further, we did not make the subscription transition in 2023 and our purchase to pure subscription revenue mix in 2023 was consistent with what we had in 2022, our outlook for total revenues in 2023 would have been more in the range of about $115 million to $120 million reflecting growth of over 100%."
