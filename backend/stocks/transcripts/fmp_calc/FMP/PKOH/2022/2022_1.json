    "content": " SG&A expenses were $46 million compared to $40 million a year ago, with the increase due to higher selling expenses from the higher sales levels, an increase in personnel costs, and increased professional fees incurred during the first quarter. In our Assembly Components segment, sales for the quarter were a record $159 million compared to $126 million a year ago, an increase of 26% year-over-year.
