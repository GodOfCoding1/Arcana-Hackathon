    "content": " Aris Water had a strong first quarter, growing our total water volumes to approximately 1.2 million barrels per day and adjusted EBITDA to approximately $36 million, up 45% and 54% versus the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Activity levels in the New Mexico Delaware Basin continue to increase, and we saw significant growth in the use of recycled produced water by our customers, increasing recycling volumes nearly 4x versus the first quarter of last year. Under this long-term agreement, Aris will provide Chevron with extensive produced water handling and recycling services across a large portion of Chevron\u2019s core acreage in the Delaware Basin, including acreage in Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico and Culberson and Reeves counties in Texas. Alongside our substantial volume growth Amanda referenced, we recorded adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 of $35.9 million, up 54% from the first quarter of 2021, and up approximately 1% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021."
