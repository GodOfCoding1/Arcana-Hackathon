    "content": " We anticipate seeing the benefits of recent completions activity, leading to increases in our produced water volumes in the fourth quarter, but are monitoring our Water Solutions business for potential year-end slowdowns. We increased our total water volumes to over 1.4 million barrels per day, up 47% versus the third quarter of last year, and up 14% sequentially over the second quarter of this year. We saw significant volume growth in both produced water handling volumes, which were up 8% sequentially over the second quarter and Water Solutions volumes, which were up 27% sequentially over the second quarter. Maybe just as a follow-up, I mean if we are looking at third quarter, where the water sales volumes are really strong, we look at kind of how you guys have trended over the last year."
