    "content": " We generated healthy organic revenue growth in both business segments, reported our highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA on operating cashflows since our IPO in May 2019, won three contract awards over $100 million, and continued strong hiring and retention. In the first quarter, we also won two Middle East contracts worth a combined value of over $75 million related to Saudi Arabia's vision 2030 to redefine urban living in industrial cities within the kingdom. Also, after first quarter close, we were awarded a $75 million task order contract by a rail customer for a series of infrastructure projects. We generated healthy organic revenue growth at both segments, reported our highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA and operating cashflow since our IPO, continued to win large contracts, maintained our hiring momentum, and continued to be recognized as an employer of choice. I'll turn now to our operating segments, starting first with Federal Solutions, where first quarter revenue increased by $40 million or 9% from the first quarter of 2021. First quarter revenue increased by $35 million or 8% from the first quarter of 2021, all of which was organic. Critical Infrastructure adjusted EBITDA decreased by $5 million or 14% from the first quarter of 2021, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 6.9%. So, to break it down by year, the impact on this year, even though it was $4.1 million in the first quarter, it will actually be for the full year, about $1.5 million negative, and will actually have an impact, a positive impact next year of $3.5 million."
