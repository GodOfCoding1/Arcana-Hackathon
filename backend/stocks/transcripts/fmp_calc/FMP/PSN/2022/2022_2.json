    "content": " During the quarter, we achieved 9% organic revenue growth, which is our highest since our IPO and we generated adjusted EBITDA and cash flow results in-line with our expectations. In Federal Solutions, we are fortunate to have won several large single award contracts over the past few years and we're focused on driving new task orders to these existing vehicles, which is resulting in our strong organic revenue growth. The growth was partially offset by the previously discussed completion of our SWPF contract, which has a $20 million negative impact to revenue per quarter through the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million increased 18% from the second quarter of 2021, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 7.7%. Starting first with Federal Solutions, where second quarter revenue increased by $95 million or 21% from the second quarter of 2021. Federal Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million or 46% from the second quarter of 2021, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to 8.9%. Second quarter revenue increased by $34 million or 8% from the second quarter of 2021, all of which was organic. Critical Infrastructure adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3 million or 10% from the second quarter of 2021, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 6.3%. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, we expect year-over-year growth of 8% to 12% for both the third and fourth quarters with a higher growth rate in the fourth quarter to get to the midpoint of 2022 guidance range."
