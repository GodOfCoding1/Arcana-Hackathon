    "content": " The FDA granted priority review for an application seeking accelerated approval for the combination of PADCEV and KEYTRUDA in first-line metastatic bladder cancer for patients that are cisplatin-ineligible with a target action date of April 21, 2023. As a reminder, this cohort study the safety and efficacy of PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA in frontline cisplatin-ineligible patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. This is a global study evaluating PADCEV in combination with KEYTRUDA in both, cis-ineligible and cis-eligible patients, which is a broader frontline population and was enrolled in Cohort K. EV-302 is intended to support submissions around the world, including in Europe and Asia and is the confirmatory trial for a potential U.S. accelerated approval of PADCEV in the EV-103 Cohort K treatment setting. HER2CLIMB-02, our Phase 3 study of TUKYSA in combination with Kadcyla in metastatic second-line plus patients completed enrollment in June of 2022, and top line data is anticipated in the first half of this year. Additionally, for Kadcyla, we plan to present data in the first half of this year from our basket trial in combination with trastuzumab in previously treated metastatic solid tumors with HER2 alterations, with a focus on biliary tract cancers."
