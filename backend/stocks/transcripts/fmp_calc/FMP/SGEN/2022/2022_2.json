    "content": " We are pleased with TUKYSA's performance in the second quarter despite the competitive headwinds, while working towards additional European launches in 2022 and Merck is progressing regulatory submissions and reimbursement activities intended to expand TUKYSA's reach in their territories. Growth in the second quarter was 8% compared to the prior year and driven by ADCETRIS sales by Takeda as well as sales of Polivy by Roche and BLENREP by GSK, both of which are ADCs that use Seagen's technology. In addition, following the positive MOUNTAINEER study results, we look forward to a potential label expansion in the U.S. into the second-line plus setting in combination with trastuzumab in metastatic colorectal cancer patients at some point in 2023. Thanks for the question. Roger, I had one on EV-302 which you said is the confirmatory study for Cohort K. And my question is on, what is the regulatory bar for overall survival now in frontline bladder cancer with BAVENCIO maintenance being routinely used and PADCEV obviously as well in later-stage patients. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question."
