    "content": " Enlist E3 soybeans reached about 45% market penetration in the US and new product sales in Crop Protection reached over $1.9 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 30% over prior year. Our 2022 results support the value creation plan presented at Investor Day, where we outlined a framework to achieve $4.4 billion of EBITDA by 2025, with a margin range of 21% to 23% and we're on track to do just that. As a result for 2023, we expect to deliver 5% sales growth in between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion in operating EBITDA translating into yet another year of impressive margin expansion. We expect net sales to be in the range of $18.1 billion and $18.4 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint driven by pricing and strong customer demand for differentiated best-in-class technology and increased US planted area. 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, a 9% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. For the full year of 2023, we expect approximately 6% increase in market-driven cost headwinds including higher commodity prices, input costs, and freight and logistics."
