    "content": " With regards to expanding our reach, we continued to see strength and customer spaces this quarter with comp store sales performance up 7% compared to last year, which partially offset the pullback in general merchandise we saw during the quarter. While our customer engagement for this event was only slightly down year-over-year, we noted that our customers purchased fewer spaces at a higher average face value reflective of the softening of customer traffic and spend as a result of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. The performance in general merchandise was partially offset by the increase in customer space sales, which were up 7.1% compared to fiscal 2021 and contributed 230 basis points to the comp store sales. In this scenario, where we continue to experience comparable store sales declines of high single digits for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we would expect to achieve operating margins in the mid-single digits with a decline on a year-over-year basis, primarily result of SG&A deleverage in the back half of the year and to a lesser extent, gross margin pressure."
