    "content": " On a comparable store sales basis, Custom Spaces increased 2.1% compared to the prior year as a result of strength in our Preston and Elfa offerings. General Merchandise on the other hand, decreased 7.1% on a comparable store sales basis to the prior year, which once again reflects customers pulling back on their discretionary spending unless they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re provided with a compelling reason to shop. As I highlighted our Custom Spaces business continued to perform well in Q3 with average base value up 4.1% compared to last year, despite the macro headwinds. By segment, net sales for The Container Store retail business were $239.3 million, a 3.8% decrease compared to $248.6 million last year. The performance in General Merchandise was partially offset by the increase in custom space comp store sales, which were up 2.1% compared to the fiscal 2021 and positively contributed 65 basis points to comp store sales. Unearned revenue decreased to $18.8 million in Q3 this year, versus $32.1 million last year, driven by the pull forward of the transform for Elfa event, and our ability to install some of those purchase spaces within the quarter combined with the pullback in customer spending that we are experiencing."
