    "content": " Despite the many macro challenges, we delivered double-digit growth for Q4 and the full year across a number of key metrics, including, total revenue on a constant currency basis, adjusted OIBDA, and operating cash flow, which, as Steve mentioned, exceeded our full year expectations. Streaming revenue increased 5%, reflecting continued growth in subscription streaming, and a recent deal with Meta, partially offset by the market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue, and the impact of the DSP renewal. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased by 20%, with margin improving from 17.2% in the prior quarter to 18.2%, primarily due to strong operating performance, as well as a $15 million impact from the copyright settlement. Moving to our full year results, total revenue grew 16%, driven by double-digit growth in both recorded music and music publishing. But as those extraneous items, whether it be shifts and release schedules, getting a deal done a quarter late versus a quarter early, what we have done, both by bolstering our investments in recorded music, by bolstering our investments in publishing and with publishing now having lagged by way of the growth of digital revenue, is now leading by way of that growth through the focus that we've put on diversification over the last four or five or six years."
