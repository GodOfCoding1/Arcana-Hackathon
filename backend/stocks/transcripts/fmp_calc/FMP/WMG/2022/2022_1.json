    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA was $389 million, an increase of 31% with margin improvement driven by strong revenue growth in both our recorded music and publishing businesses. In Publishing, we delivered revenue of $229 million and a growth of 32% over the prior year quarter driven by double-digit increases across all revenue lines while the quarterly revenue and year-over-year growth also represent record highs. On an annualized basis, this revenue increased from $310 million in Q4 to $325 million in Q1 driven by growth in recorded music and publishing. This additional week primarily benefited our recorded music streaming revenue and will only impact Q1 as all of the subsequent quarters in fiscal '22 are 13 weeks, consistent with the prior-year. Moving now to our results, total revenue increased by over 22% on a constant currency basis and 21% on an as-reported basis, reflecting strong performance in both recorded music and music publishing. Adjusting for the net impact of the additional week, which was $60 million, and the new DSP deal, which was $28 million, our recorded music streaming revenue would have grown by approximately 18% while this new DSP deal is now consistent with our other major DSP deals. Music Publishing had a record quarter as well posting revenue of $229 million, a growth rate of 32% over the prior year quarter, reflecting double-digit growth across all revenue lines. As we look ahead, our business has more growth drivers than ever before, whether in recorded music where we continue to see growth in traditional and emerging streaming, acceleration in safe and the return of artist services in vital and at Warner Chappell now the performance is stabilizing and streaming and Sync are surging.
