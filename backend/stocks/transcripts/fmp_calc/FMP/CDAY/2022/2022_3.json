    "content": " Furthermore, in a difficult market, every organization worldwide is focused on efficient growth and the most significant asset companies have is people, Dayforce has always promised the delivery of quantifiable value, meaning real money saving and ROI back to our customers. Global traction continues with a stellar sales performance from our EMEA region in the third quarter, wherein we have strong momentum in the mid-market that's becoming consistently augmented by large global transactions with notable large enterprise EMEA-based customers. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%, exceeded our guidance range driven by revenue upside in the quarter as well as operational efficiencies as illustrated by our adjusted cloud recurring gross margin of 74.8%, an expansion of 50 basis points. Now the last point I want to make is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re raising our fiscal year 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect revised float assumptions and flow-through of profitability upside in Q3, partially offset by increased sales and marketing spend in Q4, historically, our largest sales quarter."
