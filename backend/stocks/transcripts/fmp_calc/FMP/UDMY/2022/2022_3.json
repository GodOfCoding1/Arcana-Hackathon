    "content": " Udemy Business had another impressive quarterly performance and continued to serve as our leading growth engine as revenue and ARR grew 67% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. On free cash flow, the ongoing growth of Udemy Business, which fundamentally has a better free cash flow margin, compared to adjusted EBITDA margin, was offset by increased DSO and changes in working capital funding, resulting in negative $90 million of free cash flow for Q3. Starting with our Enterprise segment, or Udemy Business, we grew Q3 revenue to $84 million, or an increase of 67% year-over-year, which includes a negative four percentage point impact from changes in FX rates. As Greg mentioned at the start, Udemy Business accounted for 53% of revenue in Q3, surpassing the consumer segment as a majority share of total revenue. We ended the quarter with over 13,400 Udemy Business customers, up 40% from a year ago and annual recurring revenue of $350 million, up 69% year-over-year. During Q3, we closed the most deals over $1 million in our history and revenue for multi-year deals accounted for over 40% of Udemy Business revenue, which increased 135% year-over-year. Udemy Business segment gross profit for the quarter was $56 million, or 67% of segment revenue, which represents a roughly 200 basis point increase year-over-year. In our Consumer segment, Q3 revenue was $75 million, down 6% year-over-year, which includes a negative 6 percentage point impact from changes in FX rates. With that as a backdrop, we expect Q4 revenue to be between $164 million and $167 million or 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint driven by continued Udemy Business momentum. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question."
