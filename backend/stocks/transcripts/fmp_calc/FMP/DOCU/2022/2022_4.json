    "content": " We added nearly 60,000 new customers in the quarter, and that's a 31% increase year-over-year. Our international revenue continued to outpace our domestic growth at 55% year-over-year to $138 million in the fourth quarter, contributing 24% of total revenue. With the addition of nearly 60,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, our total installed base grew 31% for the full year with over 1.17 million customers worldwide. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $562 million to $566 million in Q1 or a growth of 24% to 25% year-over-year and $2.39 billion to $2.41 billion for fiscal '23 or a growth of 18% year-over-year. But we see an opportunity to bring in additional in the SMB, commercial and enterprise level, a new leadership there that's had more scale experience, which is related to the fact that our North American business is still 76% of our revenue and so, therefore, significantly a higher scale than any of the international markets."
