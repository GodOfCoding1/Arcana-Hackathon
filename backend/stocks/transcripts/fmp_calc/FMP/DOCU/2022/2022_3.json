    "content": " Can you characterize the magnitude and the timing of the investment that you\u2019re going to make in sales, so we can think about what the margin profile impact from that, as well as sales for you guys usually ramps a little bit faster than traditional enterprise software, but trying to gauge when those new sales resources might actually contribute to an improvement in that top-of-funnel lead generation. And I guess, the second part of my question, as you think about these sales investments, there\u2019s a number of industries where it\u2019s -- real estate, let\u2019s pick on that one where pretty much everyone gets the value and it\u2019s generally a DocuSign request that comes through with mortgages or refis or whatever. Last year, we really outperformed our expectations more in the United States than even we did, and it was great growth internationally and international took share, but we expected it to take even more share because we had this extra sort of COVID boost that was more dramatic in the U.S. And so, similarly, as we look at Q3 and really into the whole second half of this year, that\u2019s the area where we see the hit being the hardest is in North America. I really believe the core of the sales execution was us not doing the enablement that Cynthia referred to earlier, so that the new folks in our sales organization understand the traditional DocuSign way of selling, right, where we\u2019re out with our customers and we\u2019re looking for those cross-sell opportunities, we\u2019re identifying the new use cases."
