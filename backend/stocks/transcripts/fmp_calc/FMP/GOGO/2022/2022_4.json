    "content": " Our adjusted EBITDA expectation was approximately $30 million of  targeted OpEx investments to drive future growth, broken down into three areas; first, $9 million in expected 5G spending, which reflects the shift of $6 million from 2022 to 2023 related to the chip delay; second, an increase in GDP spending to $14 million from our prior expectations of $10 million dollars; and finally, as Oak outlined in his remarks, increased investment in additional operational initiatives focused on penetrating the 70% of the business aviation in-flight connectivity market that remains untapped and maintaining our long term competitiveness."
