    "content": " In the Utility business, excluding some rate making adjustments that did not impact earnings, our underlying customer margin was up about $6 million, driven by the ongoing benefits of our infrastructure modernization tracker in New York and increased usage, which was largely related to colder weather versus last year. As you saw in last night's release, we've lowered our NYMEX natural gas price assumption to an average of $3.25 per MMBtu for the remaining 9 months of the year, which is in line with the forward markets. As we look forward, lower natural gas prices will impact our near-term cash flow, but the combination of growing production, holding the line on capital and a robust marketing and hedging portfolio mitigates a good portion of that decrease. Last evening, National Fuel reported first quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted operating results of $1.84 per share, up 24% compared to last year."
