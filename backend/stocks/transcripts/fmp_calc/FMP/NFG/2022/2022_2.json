    "content": " As we announced in last night's release, Seneca has entered into an agreement to sell our California operations to Sentinel Peak for $280 million in cash and $30 million in contingent consideration. On a consolidated basis, we now expect free cash flow from operations will be approximately $290 million, assuming the midpoint of our updated guidance ranges, adding in the expected net proceeds from the California sale and total excess cash should be in the $475 million area. As a result, Appalachian net production is expected to increase to about $950 million per day in the third quarter and then remain around that level until the end of the fiscal year when we accelerate TIL activity headed into the winter. National Fuel's GAAP earnings were $1.82 per share, while adjusted operating results for the quarter were $1.68, an increase of 25% from the prior year. Given the volatility, it's worth noting that a $0.25 change in natural gas prices impact earnings per share for the remainder of the year by roughly $0.04 per share. But as we move through the remainder of the year, the timing of cash flows related to Seneca's natural gas sales the cost for the utility to inject gas into storage this summer and any potential collateral requirements on our hedge portfolio will drive changes in short-term liquidity relative to our internal projections. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
