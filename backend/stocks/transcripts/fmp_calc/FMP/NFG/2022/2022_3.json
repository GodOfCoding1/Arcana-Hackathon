    "content": " As you saw in last night's release, we're initiating preliminary 2023 earnings guidance with a range of $7.25 to $7.75 per share, which at the midpoint is a 27% increase year-over-year. With that approach in mind, looking to 2023, total capital spending is projected to be between $830 million and $940 million, at the midpoint up just under 10% from fiscal 2022. As I've said in the past, our spending in this segment generally falls into a few main categories a routine annual maintenance which is roughly $50 million per year, in system modernization and emissions reduction spending that varies based on the projects undertaken each year but typically it will be in the range of $40 million to $70 million per year. Looking to next year, even with the roughly $75 million expected increase in capital spending free cash flow should increase to approximately $375 million. Looking to fiscal 2023, we expect to see spending flat to slightly higher in our Upstream business and up $40 million in our Gathering segment. We expect these optimization projects to be online before the end of the calendar year, helping drive our fiscal 2023 production growth of 11% at the midpoint and maximizing our upside to higher expected winter heating season pricing. From an overall balance sheet perspective, we are in a great position, with debt-to-EBITDA trending below two times over the course of the next year, combining this with our outlook for sustainable and growing free cash flow generation, we are well positioned to continue our long history of generating strong returns on our capital, while also returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders."
