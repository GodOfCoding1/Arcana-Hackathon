    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2022 National Fuel Gas Company Earnings Conference Call. With us on the call from National Fuel Gas Company are Dave Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Camiolo, Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer; and Justin Loweth, President of Seneca Resources and National Fuel Midstream. While National Fuel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations, beliefs and projections are made in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis, actual results may differ materially. Adjusted operating results were right in line with our expectations at $1.19 per share, a 25% increase over last year. Looking back, fiscal 2022 was another exceptional year for National Fuel. Operationally, we had multiple successes, including completing the FM100 project on time and under budget, growing Seneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net production by 8% and replacing more than 150 miles of pipe as part of the utilities modernization program. During the year, inflationary pressures in an extremely tight labor market impacted us across our business segments and as we discussed last quarter, we will likely have a continuing impact in 2023. While some of this was timing between fiscal years, the largest factor was related to increased costs associated with the spot frac crew that is completing two pads in Tioga County, ahead of the winter heating season. As a result, we have seen an increase in O&M expense, particularly in our Regulated businesses, where we have the largest number of employees. These inflationary challenges, along with increased rate base from our modernization program are expected to lead to rate cases in both divisions of our utility in the coming years. In short, we are asking for a $28 million annual rate increase commencing August 1, 2023. Like the system modernization tracking mechanism in New York, the DSIC would allow us to recover the cost of our Pennsylvania modernization program in a more real-time fashion. We already have the lowest delivery rates in the state by a wide margin and even after a full $28 million increase, our delivery rates will still be the lowest in the state. Switching to the outlook for our fiscal 2023, the recent drop in the natural gas forward curve has led us to revise guidance to a new range of $6.40 per share to $6.90 per share. At the midpoint, this is an $0.85 per share reduction, almost all of which is driven by our revised natural gas price assumptions. Despite the reduction, our $6.65 midpoint represents a 13% increase in expected earnings year-over-year. As a reminder, our debt policy gives us a lot of latitude allowing us to hedge between 40% and 80% of our production in the current fiscal year. Over the past few years, we have trended closer to the high end of that range and this was the result of the natural gas pricing outlook that was in place at the time we did the hedges, as well as the desire to have greater certainty around cash flows to help support our investment grade credit rating. Looking forward, we still believe hedging is an important tool to provide downside protection and I expect Seneca will continue to be active with its program. However, with the improved outlook for natural gas, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very possible our hedge percentages in fiscal 2024 and beyond will trend a bit lower within our policy range. Considering our revised earnings guidance, we now expect funds from operations will exceed capital spending by $325 million for fiscal 2023. Looking beyond 2023, the significant investments we have made across our four lines of business should lead to a sustained period of significant free cash flow generation. This puts us in the enviable position where we can simultaneously deleverage our balance sheet, return capital to shareholders through our longstanding dividend and pursue additional future growth opportunities. At a time when energy security and affordability have never been more important, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obvious to natural gas and its resilient delivery system, needs to be a central component in an all of the above approach to energy policy. Nevertheless, we continue to see policymakers in New York and elsewhere, pushing the narrative that growth in wind and solar alone can meet the needs of a fully electric world, including for winter heating and cold climates like Buffalo, without sacrificing affordability and reliability. National Fuel will continue to advocate on behalf of our customers for a more reasonable approach, one that continues to leverage our existing natural gas infrastructure, saving customers money without sacrificing energy reliability. I am particularly proud of the progress we have made towards our 2030 methane intensity reduction targets, as well as Seneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibly sourced gas certifications. In conclusion, fiscal 2022 was a great year for National Fuel and I am excited about our future. Seneca and NFG Midstream wrapped up the fourth quarter of our fiscal year with strong operational and financial performance, continuing the trend of solid execution across our Appalachian development program. For the year, net production increased by 8%, reaching a record 353 Bcfe, while adjusted EBITDA for our Non-Regulated businesses increased by 34%. This strong performance continues to be driven by our expansive high quality acreage position, the ability to deliver gas to premium markets through our valuable marketing portfolio, Gathering infrastructure connectivity and our unique integrated approach to developing our acreage. Despite the sale of 175 Bcfe of proved reserves, we replaced 240% of our fiscal 2022 production and increased our total reserve base by 319 Bcfe. Looking back, fiscal 2022 was a significant year for Seneca. We brought online multiple pads on our acquired acreage in Tioga County, with results from both the Utica and Marcellus exceeding our expectations, and we closed on the sale of our California operations, transitioning to a pure-play Appalachian natural gas producer. We also made major strides in our sustainability initiatives, including certifying our natural gas production under MiQ, Equitable Origin and Project Canary, further and independently validating our culture of environmental stewardship and operational excellence. On the heels of Seneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong results, our Gathering business also had a fantastic year, registering record throughput, significantly growing third-party volumes on our system and commencing the build-out of centralized facilities in Tioga County that will serve our growing production in the years to come. In the near-term, we expect to accelerate production with 17 new wells coming online during the first quarter, which will take advantage of the higher natural gas prices expected during the winter months. Based on the anticipated timing of these pads, our production this quarter is expected to be flat with Q4 of fiscal 2022. From there, production should continue to ramp steadily throughout the winter, spring and early summer before flattening out or modestly declining into the end of the fiscal year. Given that our operational plans are largely unchanged and we have taken steps to mitigate inflationary pressures where possible, we are maintaining our capital spending guidance range of fiscal 2023 of $525 million to $575 million. As a reminder, this incorporates the impact of the 15% inflation we experienced in fiscal 2022 and an additional expected 10% increase in fiscal 2023. At the midpoint of our fiscal 2023 guidance range, we would expect CapEx to be down slightly year-over-year. As Dave alluded to earlier, fiscal 2022 capital came in at $565 million, a bit over guidance. With a portion related to pulling capital forward from fiscal 2023 and the remainder related to higher than expected completion cost on a Tioga County pad, we plan to bring online later this month. But by Q2 of fiscal 2023, we will be solely utilizing our full time electric frac fleet under a new long-term contract. To that end, in August, Seneca achieved an A certification grade, the highest available certification for 100% of our natural gas production under the MiQ standard for methane emission performance. On the Gathering side, we also made significant progress on projects to reduce overall emissions and lower the methane intensity of our operations. For example, at The Clermont West Compressor Station, the largest owned and operated by NFG Midstream, we are working to convert current gas-driven pneumatics to our system, which we expect will be completed by the end of the calendar year. We also had a great year on safety, reporting a second straight year of zero DART injuries at Seneca and Midstream, while also maintaining and improving our contractor oversight to ensure adherence and performance in alignment with our high safety standards. In conclusion, our Upstream and Gathering business are working together hand in glove, continuously finding ways to optimize our operations plan and drive differentiated value from our significant development inventory. Looking forward, we see continued opportunities across our integrated model to enhance margins and investment returns. National Fuel closed out its fiscal year on a strong note, with GAAP earnings coming in at $1.71 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted operating results for the quarter were $1.19 per share, an increase of 25%. Higher natural gas prices, the increase in Seneca\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production and its corresponding impact on Gathering throughput, along with the benefits of our FM100 pipeline project were all key drivers during the quarter. Additionally, we accrued an expense related to a short-term incentive program for our supervisory workforce that is tied to strong corporate performance for the year across a number of metrics. While operating costs are rising alongside the broader inflationary headwinds, the topline of our Regulated businesses is performing really well. Utility margin was up 3% year-over-year, while revenues in our Pipeline and Storage segment were up $13 million or 15% over last year. The increase in Pipeline revenues was largely attributable to our FM100 project along with some good results in our short-term business, which helped push us over the high end of our guidance range. Turning to next year, we have reduced our earnings guidance to a range of $6.40 per share to $6.90 per share or $6.65 at the midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, every $0.50 change in NYMEX natural gas prices impacts earnings by approximately $0.45. Due to our pension plans, becoming fully funded and significantly de-risked, we made a voluntary filing to step recovering revenue from our customers that was used to fund these plans. EBITDA will be reduced by $18 million with an offsetting benefit in non-service pension costs, which falls below operating income on our income statement. Moving to capital, our consolidated spending was in line with our prior guidance for fiscal 2022 and our plans for fiscal 2023 remain unchanged. From an overall cash flow perspective, fiscal 2022 was a great year. Between cash from operations, our capital spending and proceeds from the sale of our California properties, we were able to reduce our outstanding debt by $100 million during the year. Looking to fiscal 2023, we now expect funds from operations to exceed capital spending by approximately $325 million. This is down $50 million from our prior guidance and is driven primarily by our revised natural gas price assumptions, partly offset by a lower expected cash tax rate, which we now forecast to be in the high-single digits as compared to the mid-teens in our prior guidance. This puts us in a great spot to continue growing our longstanding dividend and to fully redeem the $549 million of long-term debt that is maturing next March, which we expect to accomplish with a combination of cash flow and short-term debt as necessary. With our strong balance sheet and outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a great financial position going forward. I was actually sort of thinking about what do you think long-term maintenance CapEx for the E&P business, Gathering business, Pipeline and segment and Utility business. It would be a little bit different, because unlike today where we are continuously operating a couple of rigs, utilizing top hole rig and we will have active completions, and we are growing our production, as I have spoken about and plan to continue to grow in that mid-to-high single digits. Moving to kind of a flat mode, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same cadence of completions and that would cause a little variability year-to-year at Seneca. So, Karen, if I understand, so cash taxes in fiscal 2023 will now be in the high-single digits versus the mid-teens prior. So, I mean, I think, we will be over the next few years definitely moving into the mid-teens and as far as when we would be a full taxpayer, we are looking at probably 2024. It seemed to me that they pretty much ignored costs and reliability, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our hope that they take a more reasoned all of the above or hybrid approach, however you want to describe it, approach to energy policy going forward. I think, regardless of the scoping plan, when you just look at the overall trends towards decarbonization, independent of what happens there or at Seneca, we have the ability to participate in RNG, hydrogen and alike, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an area that we have teams in place that are looking at that and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my hope and expectation that over time, we will come to a point where we are able to make investments there. For the near-term, we are going to be operating a two-rig program, generating considerable free cash flow and we are going to do that regardless of what happens in New York and the level of capital that we are talking about on the RNG and hydrogen side isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so big that it would put a two-rig program or make it difficult to fund a two-rig program. We will continue to do so and we will continue to be basically adhering to the principles we put out before, which is focusing on assets where we see them as either continuous or very contiguous or very proximate to our existing acreage, ideally having an opportunity to leverage our integrated model, whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Gathering side or at Supply and Empire. And you all have a good chunk of firm takeaway capacity or firm sales already baked in, but looking at the revised guide that saw basis dips widening, especially in the second half of 2023. Overall for the year, we have got 88% of our forecasted production flowing through either firm transport and/or firm sales. And then on slide 29, what you can really see is, we have developed our portfolio to kind of meet our expected growing production throughout the year. And so, where we are today versus the growth that we expect through the year, particularly into to Q3, you can see that following the quarterly disclosure on our firm sales. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively minor exposure for us, given our positioning on firm sales and then you combine that with our kind of hedge and fixed price position, which is roughly of two-thirds. So on an annualized basis, its well over -- the net difference between the gas versus the diesel is well over $10 million. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty big move to go from one input fuel to the other from a cost perspective, and obviously, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some great intangibles there from an emissions and our long-term sustainability goals as well.
