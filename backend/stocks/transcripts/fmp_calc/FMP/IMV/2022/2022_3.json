    "content": " R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2022, were approximately $330,000 higher compared to the third quarter in 2021, primarily as a result of nonrecurring costs related to the September restructuring as well as the progression of our Phase 2b trials in DLBCL advanced ovarian cancer and our non-muscle invasive bladder cancer study. Whilst the outstanding eight of 10 patients in SPiReL with PD-1 positivity as a result we certainly seek to replicate, we also need to appreciate that in the period post the study completing, and now we're enrolling in VITALIZE, the landscape has changed significantly, and there are cell therapies that were not present when we did the first study. But I would also say that because of the way our mechanism seems to -- well, it's not seems to, biologically is different and separate to so many of the therapies that they've progressed through, we're very confident that even in a refractory patient, with the biology of maveropepimut and therapeutic efficacy will stand up."
