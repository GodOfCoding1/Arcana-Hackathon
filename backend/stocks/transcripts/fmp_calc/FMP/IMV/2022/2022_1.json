    "content": " This on top of the encouraging data in DLBCL in ovarian cancer conforms the broad therapeutic opportunity to MVP-S. Once more, the balance we have continuously demonstrated between efficacy and tolerability, and heavily pre -treated patients populations creating unique value proposition for MVP-S and the other products, the DPX Also in the first quarter, we dosed out first patient in the DLBCL VITALIZE trial. I showed you the data from our advanced metastatic bladder cancer study, wherein we had complete and partial responses in patients who had previously failed checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We also have an earlier stage bladder cancer study wherein we're comparing our first product, maveropepimut-S, to our second clinical product, DPX-SurMAGE. We're planning additional meetings without K. to discuss the next steps following our positive data from our basket trial in bladder cancer patients, and planning the design of the potential trial. There are really multiple opportunities, as you know, across the treatment landscape for bladder cancer patients, both opportunities in early disease as well as opportunities in the advanced metastatic setting, where we can combine with checkpoint inhibitors either as naive patients or we can bond after at the checkpoint inhibitor treatment. I would expect that the way we will develop bladder cancer if we move forward with checkpoint combination, would be very intently with a strategic partner in such a way that we would start to develop a relationship, beyond the relationship, we obviously already with Mark, that gives us some flexibility to say open-minded with that question."
