    "content": " In February, we made public that in an early look of patient data from the VITALIZE trial, maveropepimut, a cancer vaccine, had demonstrated efficacy in patients with DLBCL that are refractory to the most advanced therapies ever created. The fact that we have seen the same number of complete responses in the first handful of patients as we had seen for the whole SPiReL trial and those complete responses have been confirmed by at least two scans, one at 70 and one at 140 days is to say the least encouraging. And so I think when we reflect on our data, when we continuously see shrinkage of advanced disease, not just in one disease setting, not just diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but also metastatic bladder, also advanced metastatic ovarian cancer, gives great confidence that the way our drug works, the way it consistently and continuously feeds immune instruction into the immune system. And as we look through the entire roster of data, when we get all 30 evaluable patients available to us, we will be able to understand whether or not the benefit that we saw in SPiReL ring-fenced by PD-L1 status holds true in this larger international company-sponsored trial or if we are seeing the benefit across a wider swap of patients."
