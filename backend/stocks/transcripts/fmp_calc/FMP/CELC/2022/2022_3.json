    "content": " Also during the quarter, an abstract with updates to results from our Phase 1b advanced breast cancer study was accepted for a Spotlight Poster Discussion presentation at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Preliminary data from this study was presented last year at a Spotlight Poster Discussion and included data from the cohort of second and third-line patients, who received the 3 weeks on, 1 week off dosing schedule that we're using in our Phase 3 study. For purposes of calculating net loss per share, the reported net loss of $0.75 per share included an additional $0.02 loss per share related to an approximately $0.3 million deemed dividend resulting from a warrant modification. Because these quarterly net losses include significant non-cash items, including stock-based compensation and interest, we also included in our press release non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the quarter ending September 30th, 2022. I outlined the process that's required where financial operational documentation has to be prepared and approved, each site needs to either get a central IRB to approve the study or an institutional IRB, in some cases, particularly hospitals and larger institutions, Independent Ethic Committees -- Ethics Committees will need to approve or Scientific Committee."
