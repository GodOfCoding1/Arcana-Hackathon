    "content": " And second, we reported very promising results from our Phase 1b study that evaluated gedatolisib plus palbociclib combined with either letrozole or fulvestrant for patients lacking PIK3CA mutations. For the patients in Arm D of the Phase 1b study, those who received the Phase 3 dosing schedule of gedatolisib, the ORR or objective response rate was 60% in PIK3CA wild-type patients and the percentage of patients who are progression-free at 12 months was 49%. Of note is that the median PFS and expansion RMA patients alone was not reached as of the June 22 data cutoff, -- we will present updated efficacy data for expansion RMA as well as for the combined data for the two arms with treatment-naive patients at the ESMO breast cancer meeting in May. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. It would demonstrate that gedatolisib has the potential not only to be, we think, potentially a standard of care second-line drug data suggests we can move up line or certainly the potential for that in breast cancer as well as in other tumor types.
