    "content": " I think just for perspective, last quarter when we reported on the first quarter and we\u2019re preparing, I think at that point we had announced already our May 1st price increase, that was really based on an anticipated annual inflation number that was in the $30 million to $35 million range across the categories that covered our source materials, our raw materials, our freight inflation and all of those things that we were we were seeing. And as Michel commented earlier, some of these supply chain disruptions, I mean, the fires, the winter storms and all of those disruptions in the global supply of some of our key raw materials have really increased the price and it put us on force -- we\u2019ve been on force majeure with some of our suppliers and that has a trickle-down impact to the cost in our manufacturing facilities because the plants can\u2019t necessarily operate with a full supply and so we\u2019re slowing down production based on the materials that we have, based on what the suppliers can provide. As we look forward, we do see a significant amount of that inflation impacting us in the second half of the year based on some of the inventory turns, some of our inventories are at low levels because we\u2019re trying to get the supply and I think both we will recognize through sales some of this higher cost inventory as we sell it in the second half."
