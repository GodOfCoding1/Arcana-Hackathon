    "content": " Through the third quarter, Forrester Decisions now makes up over 25% of our CV approaching $100 million of contribution. And finally, for our Events business, although Q3 is traditionally a light quarter for us, the business posted revenues of $3.3 million, representing an increase of 276% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Finally, net income increased 38% and earnings per share increased 39% compared to Q3 of last year with net income at $10.9 million and EPS at $0.57 for the current quarter compared with net income of $7.9 million and earnings per share of $0.41 in the third quarter of 2021. Finally, for our Events business, we expect fourth quarter revenues to increase by approximately 30% to 40% compared to the previous year, and we expect Event revenues for the full year to increase by approximately 130% to 140% compared to 2021. In terms of other guidance, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect our operating margin to be 6% to 8% and have raised our full year operating margin by 50 basis points to be 12% to 13% given ongoing cost controls. Given the upside on our EPS in the third quarter and our ability to manage the P&L, we now expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, which is an increase of $0.05 on both the top and bottom end of the range compared to our previous guide. Yes, in terms of the slowdown of the key metrics, so as you noted in the prepared remarks, especially on client retention and wallet retention, but we think that they're going to continue to decline in the short term due to those macroeconomic issues along with the accelerated transition of the legacy base in the FD platform, but we expect retention to remain in the low 70s, mid-low 70 to the near term with a long-term target to obviously 80-plus percent."
