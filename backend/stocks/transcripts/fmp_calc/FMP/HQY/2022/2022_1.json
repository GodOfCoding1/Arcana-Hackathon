    "content": " I don\u2019t know what deals will be concluded in the second quarter, third quarter, or fourth quarter, but we do even after this current transaction, we\u2019ve -- transactions we have a little bit of powder left for those kinds of things and for those kinds of portfolio type things, and we won\u2019t hesitate to go forward if we think they\u2019re strong return for shareholders, so that\u2019s kind of where I am at right now. There just is a lot better focus and people are making choices and we want to win them all, but sometimes leaders will say it\u2019s better almost to get it know we\u2019re going in a different direction, then put this on hold for another year, because it kind of resets the clock and we\u2019re pretty confident that when people even if they don\u2019t choose HealthEquity, they\u2019re going to choose us at some point and I think we\u2019ve just seen a lot more of this positive intent to make choices move ahead, continue to offer health savings accounts and other CDBs to their membership base. But if you really think about the whole the whole aspect of our custodial and service revenue line items, it\u2019s almost starting to feel, when I think about deals of signing off on as a blend of it, because I\u2019m thinking -- to that particular customer and that\u2019s even more so true when you think about bundling sales together and finding opportunities to have more profit there essentially being able to get better pricing on certain things in the service fee area to increase the amount of margin that we\u2019re able to take off of those. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see that a little bit and to the extent that, like, Jon said, over the long-term, we can get rates to rebound that creates a huge opportunity for us and I think it\u2019s not going to be anything that\u2019s going to be an extreme amount of the decrease relative to that service revenue line item."
