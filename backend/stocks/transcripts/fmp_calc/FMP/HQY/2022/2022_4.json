Ted, why don't you take this one, because it's -- I think it's -- this is really about what we're doing technologically and what the market is asking us to do as new clients come in around driving HSA adoption. The 25 basis points, I mean if you think about that, that's really something that only affects the variable contract that we have -- so we won't place real money again, big money until next January. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, it's just -- I can't -- we're not going to forecast any pandemic-related things, and I specifically mentioned that. So, we're trying to get back to a more normalized place, but just really trying to make sure that we think we've got the seasonality nailed on that where it's heavier, of course, in the January, February, March timeframe because people get their FSAs topped up and their HSAs. So, I just think that as you quarterize this and answer that's kind of roughly flat on a per account basis, it's -- just keep in mind that seasonality, that is that last year -- exactly as you said, the second quarter is overstated and the third quarter is probably understated, but it's still not -- it is seasonally the weakest quarter. Your line is open. And I think that's probably the biggest potential difference here is that just as we got to kind of a place where people were feeling normal and a little bit of wobbliness toward the end of 2019, but whatever, still in the range of normal -- boom, we got the pandemic. And so, we don't have the leeway to, like say we're running a special to come in, here's -- like you'll see sometimes banks do. Your line is open."
