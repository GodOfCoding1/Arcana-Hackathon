    "content": " In fact, BOA's $25 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter represents the highest EBITDA producing quarter CODI's business has ever reported. As we have said on prior calls, BOA's unique combination of disruptive technology, strong intellectual property, relatively low penetration in a very large addressable market, when combined with an extraordinary management team, has left a performance that is significantly stronger than expected when we acquired the business 1.5 years ago. However, as a result of our company's strong performance in the first quarter that exceeded our expectations, we are raising our 2022 full year consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA outlook to between $410 million and $430 million, a $10 million increase in the bottom and the top end of the range. And it's a massive advantage to us, whether we sit in today's market or we sit in a market that was relatively robust from a financing standpoint a year ago, it's why we think permanent capital is really sort of what a lot of people would like to emulate that are competing for these types of assets because it is so advantageous in terms of not only being able to win companies, but being able to build businesses."
