    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that we continued our strong momentum in the second quarter of the year as we recorded our sixth consecutive record quarter at our sixth straight quarter of double-digit increases in pro forma consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA, once again, enabling us to raise our 2022 outlook. However, as a result of our Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong performance in the second quarter that exceeded our expectations and our current view of the economy, we are once again raising our 2022 full-year consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we are no longer adding back management fees in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, and therefore, our consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA range would come down by roughly $8 million at the top and bottom end of the range. And so if you think about just the amount of fixed expenses that we come underneath, including interest and management fees, we think that high single-digit growth rate of subsidiary adjusted EBITDA should leverage into strong kind of growth rates and adjusted earnings just based on how the math works."
