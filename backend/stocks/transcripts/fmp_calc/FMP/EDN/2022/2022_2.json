    "content": " The gross margin accumulated as of 30th of June 2022 was of ARS 24,212 million, which represented a fall of 16% compared to the same period of the previous years, mainly due to the tariff freeze. Furthermore, Edenor customer space rose by 2.1% compared to the same period of the previous years, reaching more than 3.2 million of customers, mainly on account of the increase in residential customers and small commercials as a result of the market disciplined actions and the installation over the last year of more than 6,416 integrated energy meters that were mainly intended for the regularization of clandestine connections. During the first 6 months of the 2022, Edenor's capital expenditures totalized ARS 8,655 million against ARS 10,131 million in the same period in 2021, with a decrease in 15% in real terms, but still maintaining its quality services for all its clients."
