    "content": " The gross margin corresponding to the third quarter 2022 was ARS 14,730 million, which represents a fall of 34% compared to the same period of the previous years, mainly due to the lack of VAD adjustments. Furthermore, Edenor's customers amount rose by 1.5% compared to the same period of the previous years, reaching more than 3.2 million customers, mainly on account of the increase in small commercial and industrial as a result of the economic recovery. Net results recorded losses of ARS 6,082 million, which is 450% higher in comparison to the third quarter of 2021, mainly due to the deterioration of the operating results and greater financial charges caused by the deferral of payment of obligations with CAMMESA. During the first 9 months of 2022, Edenor's capital expenditures totalized ARS 16,802 million against ARS 18,935 million in the same period in 2021, with a decrease of 11% in real terms, but still maintains its services for quality of its clients.
