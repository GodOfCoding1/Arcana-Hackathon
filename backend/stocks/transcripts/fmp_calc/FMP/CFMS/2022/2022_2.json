    "content": " And as highlighted last quarter, we expect to increase inventory over the next few quarters to support our product launch cadence which includes the full commercial launch of Imprint and the limited market releases of our Actera hip and porous coated knee. Based on our updated expectations for the third quarter, factoring in our new timelines for the full market release of Imprint and a limited market release of Actera hip and the ongoing portfolio transition, we expect our full year product revenue to be between $57 million and $61 million. And so we're highly competent based on discussions with that supplier, though it's late that they will make the new communicated date, and that gives us confidence that we'll be able to get into limited release on this product sort of late Q3."
