    "content": " One, we initiated the full commercial launch of our Imprint knee; two, we formally transitioned to our new Platinum Services model on September 1; three, we received 510(k) clearance of the Actera Hip System and are positioned to launch the limited market release shortly; and four, our international sales grew 5% in constant currency primarily through our continued progress in Australia. Product revenue was in line with our expectations at $13.6 million, which is down 3% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis, versus the third quarter of last year. And as highlighted last quarter, we expect to increase inventory over the next few quarters to support our product launch cadence, which includes the full commercial launch of Imprint and the limited market release of our Actera hip and porous coated knee. There's no doubt that there -- so first off, as we said in the prepared remarks, the good news is we have about 90% of our existing business contracted with Imprint. We think that probably it's like sort of 5% to 10% range, but a lot of it is short-term stuff that could -- that we think will come back after we get some exposure in Imprint and where we're at."
