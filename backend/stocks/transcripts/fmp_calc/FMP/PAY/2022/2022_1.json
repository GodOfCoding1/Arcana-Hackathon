    "content": " It's kind of a high point of the year and what we see for our average payment amount, i.e., the bill payment amounts that are getting paid on our platform largely due to utility payments being higher in Q1 because of the cold winter months. So what we talked about in the 16 billion bill payments, so we feel like that this is -- all of these things we have done, the hard work, the rails, the platform, the capabilities we have built, the workforce we have created, it's all setting a great foundation for us to continue to grow in the outer years. And because it's very understandable by the clients themselves that if they are getting more benefit by -- through the inflation by charging higher for the bills, we want the very company which is making that all happen where they're able to collect the money, we want to be able to raise the rate as well, and we have those capabilities in the agreement already built in. And so it is a very resilient model, and I think that's reflected in our results in Q1 and got us to the rest of the year that even though the macro may seem a little uncertain, one thing is constant, that people need to continue to pay their bills."
