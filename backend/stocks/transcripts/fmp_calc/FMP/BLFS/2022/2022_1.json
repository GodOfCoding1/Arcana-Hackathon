New Q1 customers by product line included 23 now using biopreservation media, 7 new ThawSTAR users, 7 new evo cold chain end users, 25 new cryogenic freezer customers, 98 new Sterling ULT freezer customers, 25 new BioStorage customers and 4 new cell processing customers now using Sexton products. Organic revenue increased 45% in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021, driven by biopreservation media revenue of $13.7 million, which was up 53% in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021. Cell processing platform is expected to be between $64 million to $67.5 million, an increase of 42% to 50% over 2021 and organic growth of 30% to 35%. Freezers and Thaw systems platform is expected to be between $74 million to $77.5 million, an increase of 31% to 37% over 2021 and organic growth of 28% to 39%. Storage and storage services platform, total and organic revenue is expected to be between $21.5 million to $26 million, an increase of 22% to 48% over 2021. In Q1, this program generated approximately $79,000 in revenue with one dedicated FTE, and we're confident that there's a strong high-margin revenue opportunity as we finalize the offering initially for the freezer line and build out our field service organization throughout this year and into next."
