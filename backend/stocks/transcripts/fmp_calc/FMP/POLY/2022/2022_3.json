    "content": " But in terms of where I see the biggest demand is really on the video side and it's tied to sort of the, tip of the iceberg concept that I outlined where people are doing these proof-of-concepts and they're excited to roll it out to thousands of rooms, but what's in the backlog today is a 100 and 200 rooms as sort of a proof-of-concept and so I think that's a fairly long-term durable trend on the video side, and it's really supply constrained, which is frustrating those are good margin products, the X30, X50, X70. We are seeing a fair amount of uptake in headset demand in places like APAC, because of some of the delays of returning to the office, but I think the 195, 200 range on the headset side feels pretty good, but we are seeing a pretty significant shift mix within the headset category, which is there's a lot of backlog tied to our Bluetooth and DECT headsets."
