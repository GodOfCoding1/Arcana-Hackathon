    "content": " Modeled results using the average of \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824 with the current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound, our annual EBITDA would range from roughly $6 billion per year at $3 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper. We will factor in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we conduct this feasibility study at Bagdad and begin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the continued discussions with our Board, we will factor in whatever the current price outlook is for capital and operating costs, even though we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t focus in on a particular copper price, but what does scenario copper prices look like and how does it fit into our overall portfolio. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as Richard was saying, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t predict exact timing, but we know we can be more efficient about doing a project in a different environment than where we sit today in the U.S.\n You just certainly highlighted the fact that the hurdle for the industry is much higher and certainly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to exacerbate whatever supply/demand gap you anticipate going forward because of what you just enumerated. And the fact that so many new deposits are underground, etcetera, etcetera, but now this current situation we are going through right now with the uncertainties about the relationship between input costs and prices, about the availability of material, supply and supply chain issues, about labor issues, particularly in the U.S., all those things are just adding to the supply barriers for the industry."
