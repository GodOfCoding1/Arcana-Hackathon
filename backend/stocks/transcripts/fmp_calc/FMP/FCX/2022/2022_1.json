    "content": " But we're looking today at $4.70 copper at current market with a cash cost of $1.44 estimated for this year, which will generate very strong margins for us. Well, if you go back, I'll talk about three years of copper demand, when copper was correlated to industrial production before China emerged in roughly 2003 as the China era, and now we're in a new era of copper prices, it's been various factors. We've had significant growth in 2021, again in 2022, but it's not common in our industry to see that kind of growth in copper production, and that's really what underpins the fundamental outlook for it. And now with 40% of the copper coming from Chile and Peru and those companies -- countries going through political discussions about the direction of how they're going to be treating the industry, that's clearly a factor that's out there."
