    "content": " Arko generated $31.8 million in net income, an increase of over 24% versus the prior year's second quarter. Total fuel gross profit was $130.8 million, a 15.1% increase compared to $113.7 million in the second quarter of 2021. Merchandise margin dollars for the second quarter of 2022 increased by $9 million versus the prior year, while margin percent increased 170 basis points to 30.4% from 28.7%. Retail fuel profitability, excluding intercompany charges for the second quarter of 2022 grew 15% this quarter to $13.7 million versus Q2 2021. The company increased retail fuel margin to $0.413 per gallon versus $0.43 per gallon versus the prior year quarter, an increase of 20.4%. For the second quarter of 2022, wholesale fuel profitability, excluding intercompany charges, increased approximately $3.5 million compared to the prior year period. Fuel contribution from fuel supply locations increased by $1.9 million, excluding intercompany charges compared to the prior year period due to greater prompt-pay discounts related to higher fuel costs and greater rebates. Fuel margin also increased $0.69 per gallon or 27.2% to $0.323 per gallon compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to greater prompt-pay discounts related to higher fuel costs, greater fuel rate dates and improved RAC to retail margins. Moving on, second quarter store operating expenses increased $23.4 million or 15.1% versus prior year due to an increase in expenses at same stores, including higher personnel costs, credit card fees and as a result of our 2021 acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $79 million, an increase of $3.3 million or 4.4% compared to the second quarter of 2021. And I think that right now in July, you're going to see that it's actually turning in another direction when price of fuel is basically almost $1 less."
