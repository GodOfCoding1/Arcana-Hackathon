    "content": " In regards to candidate supply, we've been in a very candidate constrained environment for well over a decade and frankly that has changed and likely will change in the current environment, it does appear that some of the largest companies may have over hired and as I mentioned, are doing a little bit of pruning over the last few months and I think that you're seeing selective pruning in those investments There might be a bit of incremental supply the clients are still being really selective and in our hiring process and we don't see that impacting any future expectation for what that candidate supply looks like, I think it's going to continue to be a tight one."
