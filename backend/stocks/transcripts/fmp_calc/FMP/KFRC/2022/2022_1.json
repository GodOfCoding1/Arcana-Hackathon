    "content": " While we don\u2019t expect continued growth, at this pace, in direct-hire revenues, which constitute less than 4% of total revenues, the benefit in a greater percentage of Technology revenues is notable and provides significant margin stability given both our ability to manage bill/pay spreads and the increasing desire by our clients to engage our firm for project-based work. Your line is open. And the reason that I say it's the early innings, some of the things that we're seeing from clients that have been more aggressive about trying to drive technologists, and I'm just going to talk about technologists and not the market as a whole given that's 85% of our footprint and growing, but those that are trying to drive the technologists back into the office and basically said, you got to be back in five days, we've seen them now migrating to, okay you only have to be in three days, you only have to be in two days. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so to what Kye had mentioned, we\u2019re bringing on a lot of skilled individuals that are coming out of solutions organizations that have really allowed us to build a strong team, and we continue to outpace our growth within this area versus our overall tech growth, roughly 27%. Your line is open. Your line is open."
