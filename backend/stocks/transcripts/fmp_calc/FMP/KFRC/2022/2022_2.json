    "content": " Due to our continued focus on investments in our Technology business, we expect overall FA revenues to decline in the low double digits sequentially and may be down approximately 35% year-over-year in the third quarter. Overall SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points year-over-year due to a 50 basis point gain recorded in the prior year as a result of the sale of our corporate headquarters, higher levels of performance-based compensation as a result of our strong financial performance, as well as continued high levels of technology investments to support our business going forward. And what I would add to Dave's comment is our strategy is we've conveyed in prior quarters, is to continue to reposition our FA business and really migrated towards that higher skill roles that are more synergistic with our technology business. So that business in and of itself, is doing I think well, I mean, we had indicated in the third quarter that the trends in FA are going to decline because of the investments we're continuing to make in technology."
