    "content": " These new products improve upon MACOM\u2019s already strong competitive position in these markets by supporting long-haul metropolitan and Data Center Interconnect, or DCI applications. But from our point of view, I can tell you that MACOM\u2019s I&D business, if you look back over the past 5, 6 years, was very weak due to lack of attention, and that changed in 2019 where we began to focus on the market. And we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve moved over the last 3 years, our revenue from being range found really in the $30 million to low $40 million per quarter, up from -- to the high 40s to the 50s and now we\u2019re in the 70s. And I think if you go back a few years, we brought our inventory levels down to what we thought were healthy levels over the past couple of quarters, there\u2019s been a bit of a build in our inventory for strategic purposes, and I think that\u2019s played out well for us in terms of supporting future growth and revenue opportunities as they emerge."
