    "content": " Strong growth in all of our businesses continued in the second quarter, demonstrating that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for whole health solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing the consumer experience. We grew enrollment year-over-year in each of our benefit businesses with approximately 90% of our membership growth being organic, supplemented by the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Health Plans, which added 255,000 members and 43,000 Medicaid members in the first and second quarters of this year, and together strengthened our footprint in two attractive existing markets. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial; premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends; the acquisitions of Paramount and Integra; and the timing of the MMM acquisition, which closed at the end of the second quarter in the prior year. The strong performance in our services businesses is being driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy to work side-by-side with our health plans, the scale services that drive differentiated value for consumers, beginning with the more than 47 million medical members, which includes the more than 20 million that are fully insured, for whom we can more quickly roll out new capabilities. Beyond helping to improve our members' lives and reducing health care costs across the system, the growth of Carelon and IngenioRx are aiding diversification of Elevance Health's businesses and producing cash flow in noninsurance and therefore, nonregulated entities. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, a proxy for business between Carelon and IngenioRx and our own risk-based health plans grew 24% year-over-year in the second quarter and represented 21.8% of the consolidated benefit expense, up from 20.5% a year ago."
