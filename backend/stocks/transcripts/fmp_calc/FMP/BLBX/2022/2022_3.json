We first look at SG&A and SG&A was $1.191 million for the third quarter as compared to $1.098 million in 2021 and $3.615 million for the nine-month period as compared to $2.321 million for the nine months ended 2021, reflecting a pretty consistent level of spending you see throughout 2022. The new products are focused on either professional traders that have to have tools, because they don't have the luxury of deciding they're going to sit out the market for a quarter or a year until it comes back."
