    "content": " Beyond offering an important treatment option to patients living with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder-related agitation, IGALMI\u2019s FDA approval validates BioXcel\u2019s AI-enabled drug discovery and development platform, which progressed from first in human trials to approval in just under 3.5 years. The research shows that the price point we are setting today provides a robust foundation for IGALMI with flexibility to adjust for future potential 501 indications, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related agitation and major depressive disorder across treatment settings. Please proceed with your question. Then I guess thinking about what you guys clarify as the trade launch in the third quarter, between now and then, can you just maybe walk us through what our expectations should be for that process, and then as maybe just a follow-up, I\u2019ll give it to you guys now on the Alzheimer\u2019s agitation program, what was the dose--can you just remind us of the dosing rationale, because I seem to recall that the 40\u00b5g was a newer addition relatively recently. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. The payors\u2019 expectations are a little bit different in the community or retail setting than they are in the hospital setting, and so we believe that we have a price point that gives us a good gross to net value and puts our contracting negotiations in a fairly conservative place. Please proceed with your question."
