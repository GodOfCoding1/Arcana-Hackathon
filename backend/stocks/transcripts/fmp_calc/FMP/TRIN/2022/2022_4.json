    "content": " The decrease in NAV per share was primarily the result of net investment income that exceeded the company's declared dividend by $0.01 per share offset by the unrealized depreciation and realized losses recognized during the fourth quarter, approximately 75% of the unrealized depreciation was related to two portfolio companies, FemTec Health and Core Scientific, previously identified as troubled credits in prior quarters. Turning specifically to our fourth quarter financial performance, our portfolio growth of 45% during 2022 and the increase in benchmark rates contributed to our total investment income of $41.5 million, a 75.8% increase over the same period in 2021 and a 7.3% increase over the third quarter of 2022."
