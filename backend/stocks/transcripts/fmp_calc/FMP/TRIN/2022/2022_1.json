    "content": " The difference between the unrealized appreciation and our realized gains solely unused in Matterport, of approximately $19 million was attributable to the drop in the public stock price between the valuation date at December 31, 2021, and the price at which we were able to eventually sell the shares after the respective lockup periods ended, while we have been fortunate to capitalize on the recent strong performance from companies in our portfolio to generate shareholder returns, we are not equity investors, and we will generally sell our equity positions as soon as it is practical to do so."
