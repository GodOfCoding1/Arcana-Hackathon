    "content": " On a comparative basis, when fully burdening the first quarter of fiscal 2021 results with public company costs and our current share count, fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS would have been $0.15 per share, which indicates fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS growth of 32% versus the prior year quarter. Through this lens, we are reaffirming full year fiscal 2022 guidance, which calls for: net sales of $353 million to $360 million, reflecting 5% to 7% organic growth; adjusted EBITDA of $118 million to $122 million or 1% to 4% growth; adjusted EPS of $0.54 to $0.57 per share, which assumes a 25% effective tax rate; and $114.5 million to $116.5 million diluted shares outstanding."
