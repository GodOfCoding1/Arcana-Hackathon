    "content": " Sales and marketing expenses were $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $13.8 million in the same period in 2021. G&A expense was $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2022, which was flat compared to Q4 and up compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2021. And finally, net income grew 296% year-over-year to $1.4 million and produced $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2022 and adjusted EBIDA grew 897% to $3.1 million. Now turning to the outlook for 2022, our total revenue estimate remains in the range of $152 million to $170 million, representing growth of 15% to 30% over the previous year. It would basically be a result of the sales productivity here in the first, second and to some degree third quarter of the year as those orders eventually turn into gross billings, to insurance companies and we start seeing some cash. So the revenue for this year is pretty much set as we get well into the third quarter of the, because any new reps that get at it as you said, we are trending towards, towards the end of the year be at least close to 500 sales reps. And what new reps in the fourth quarter for instance might contribute with is certainly not going to add to the revenue this year, that'll be revenue next year. So it's the \u2013 of all the products we distribute as Thomas mentioned, I think Cervical Traction is the highest LSOs or back braces are kind of second, and then as we mentioned the knee braces are gaining fast, so they're... And then post-op we rolled it out a little bit later, so it's not picking up as fast but we're also seeing traction with that as well."
