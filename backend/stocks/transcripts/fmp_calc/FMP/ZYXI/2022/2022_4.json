    "content": " Total revenue for the quarter was $48.8 million, a 21% increase over the same period in 2021. Earlier this year, we finished our third $10 million stock buyback and we feel strongly that these buybacks underscore management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence in the performance and of our team and the growth potential of both the pain management and the monitoring division in years to come. We ended 2022 with approximately 450 sales reps and our full year annual revenue per rep was approximately $400,000. Orders grew 48% year-over-year, and net revenue grew 21% to $48.8 million from $40.4 million in 2021. For the full year, orders grew 23%, and net revenue grew 21% to $158.2 million from $130.3 million in 2021. Cash from operations increased 98% during 2022, which allowed us to initiate our third $10 million stock buyback, pay a cash dividend and pay down our debt related to the Kestrel acquisition by $5 million. As for our 2023 outlook, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million, representing growth approximately 21% over 2022 and diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.50 a share. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $39 million to $41 million with adjusted earnings per share of $0 to $0.03. And the assumptions assume that as Dan mentioned earlier that by the end of the year, we can get up to around 550 sales reps. And as they continue to become more and more productive, we expect that to turn into revenue in the $180 million to $200 million range."
