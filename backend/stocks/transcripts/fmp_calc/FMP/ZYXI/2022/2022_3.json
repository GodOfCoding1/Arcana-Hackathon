    "content": " Total revenue for the quarter was $41.5 million, diluted earnings per share of $0.13 and adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million. In Q3, orders grew 34% year-over-year, and net revenue grew 19% to $41.5 million from $34.8 million in 2021. Net income was $4.9 million and produced $0.13 per diluted share in the third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million. Also of note, cash from operations during Q3 was $7.4 million, which was our second best quarterly result in the company's history. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, orders grew 15% and net revenue grew 22% to $109.4 million from $89.9 million in 2021. Cash from operations increased $9.6 million year-to-date, which allowed us to complete our second buyback, pay a cash dividend and pay down our debt related to the Kestrel acquisition by $4 million. As I stated previously, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to come in between $48 million and $51 million with adjusted EBITDA between $10 million and $12 million. This puts us in a position with our full year 2022 estimate for revenue in the range of $157.4 million to $160.4 million, representing growth of approximately 22% over the year of 2021. So we get closer to the million dollars per year in average revenue per rep. And obviously, as we saturate all the open territory is more than we will naturally just looking at the math that goes into it, we'll start seeing the increased revenue productivity per rep in the coming years, but it's all about populating all 800 territories."
