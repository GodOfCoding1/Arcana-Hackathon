    "content": " We have worked very hard over the past 12 years to position Xcel Brands as a design, production and media platform focused on driving growth in consumer brands through a live stream driven strategy, and are pleased both, with the success we have been able to achieve under our brands on direct response television, as well as our ability to materially increase the long-term value of our brands; there is no better example than our Isaac Mizrahi brand that generated $30 million of retail sales when we acquired it in 2011, and is now generating over $350 million in annual retail sales. Total revenue for the first quarter 2022 was $8.7 million, representing an increase of approximately $0.9 million or 12% from the prior year quarter, and primarily related to our acquisition of the Lori Goldstein brand in April 2021. Our operating expenses were $10.1 million for the current quarter, up $1.6 million from $8.5 million in the prior quarter; this increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the Lori Goldstein brand including $0.6 million of additional non-cash trademark amortization expense. Overall, our net loss excluding non-controlling interest for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately $3.5 million or minus $0.18 per share, compared with $2.5 million or minus $0.13 per share in the first quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, our net loss for the current quarter was $1.9 million or minus $0.10 per share, compared with $1.5 million or minus $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2021."
