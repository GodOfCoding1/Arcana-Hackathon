    "content": " Net wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales decreased by approximately $1.2 million in the current quarter and $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, which is approximately 27% and 24% lower, respectively, as compared with the prior year comparable period. Net licensing revenue for the current six months increased by approximately $0.6 million to $11.2 million or 6% as compared with the prior period, primarily attributable to our ownership of the Lori Goldstein brand during the entire six months in 2022 and partially offset by the sale of Isaac brand in the current year."
