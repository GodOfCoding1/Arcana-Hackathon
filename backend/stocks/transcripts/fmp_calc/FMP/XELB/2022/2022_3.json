    "content": " While, the Isaac Mizrahi transaction is having a short-term impact on our financial results, we expect the new businesses I discussed and the new projects and opportunities that are currently either planned or being considered to more than offset the lost revenue and earnings in the coming year. We expect that our new warehouse operation in Mexico, coupled with other operating efficiencies that we plan to implement by year-end, can reduce operating costs by over $2.5 million over the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 over an annualized period. Net licensing revenue for the current quarter was approximately $2.2 million, representing a decrease of approximately $4.7 million or 68% as compared with the prior year quarter. Sales decreased by approximately $2.1 million in the current quarter and $4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which is 47% and 32%, lower, respectively, as compared with the prior year comparable period. Our operating cost and expenses were $8.7 million for the current quarter, down $1 million from the $9.7 million in the prior year quarter. In the other income category, we recognized a $0.3 million equity method loss in both the current quarter and year-to-date period in accordance with the distribution provisions governing the business venture for the Isacc Mizrahi brand. Also in this category, the current nine months include the $20.6 million gain from the second quarter partial sale of the Isacc Mizrahi brand. Overall, we had net loss excluding noncontrolling interest for the third quarter of 2022 of approximately $4 million or minus $0.21 per share compared with a net loss of $1.1 million or minus $0.06 per share in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we had a net loss for the current quarter of $3.3 million or minus $0.17 per share compared with essentially breakeven net income in the third quarter of 2021."
