    "content": " Adjusted ROE is a performance measure that excludes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity investments and funds held-directly managed, in addition to other adjustments as detailed in our 10-K. We recorded a net loss of $906 million for the year, negative ROE of 15.6% and negative adjusted ROE of 1.1%. We recognized favorable results of $160 million on certain adverse development covers or ADCs; we have noted for a number of years that RLE would take some time to manifest itself given we are often last to pay on these contracts, so we are pleased to report the returns starting to come through."
