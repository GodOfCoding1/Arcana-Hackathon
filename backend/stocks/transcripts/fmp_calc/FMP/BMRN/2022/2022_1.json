    "content": " So we begin 2022 points for significant growth and the transition to sustainable GAAP profitability, interest in VOXZOGO from a family seeking a treatment option that addresses the underlying cause of achondroplasia has been very positive, as underscored by today\u2019s increase in full year 2022 VOXZOGO guidance to between $100 million and $125 million. As we look forward to the remainder of 2022, we are on our way to achieving the goals set forth at the start of the year, turning the quarter to the stable GAAP profitability, ramping up our largest pediatric opportunity to-date with VOXZOGO and progressing ROCTAVIAN applications with health authorities in Europe and the United States and also addressing the broadest exchange pipeline in our history. It\u2019s important to note that even though we expect to continue to add new VOXZOGO patients over the remainder of 2022, the mechanics of daily dosing mean that these new patients on therapy for just a portion of the year will contribute slightly less to full year 2022 revenue. So, back on VOXZOGO in the U.S. and kind of resting specialty pharmacy inventory, you could judge from the mix of revenue ex-U.S. and U.S. And so, well, BioMarin is guiding the $7 million of revenue was U.S. And really, they don\u2019t have to because we have got really good reorder dynamics for them."
