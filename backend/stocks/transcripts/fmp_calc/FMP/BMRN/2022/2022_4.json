    "content": " We were pleased to see our efforts to drive new patients initiating PALYNZIQ therapy in the U.S. and Europe, results in net product revenue growth of 7% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and achieved $255 million for the full year. BioMarin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s durable and growing enzyme products business has helped BioMarin reach GAAP profitability, we are launching two of the highest potential products in company history with VOXZOGO globally and ROCTAVIAN outside of the U.S. and we are investing in BioMarin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest ever early-stage research pipeline intended to fuel growth throughout this decade and beyond. And I would say, just like my comments about the United States, having targeting a small number of the largest and most capable hemophilia treatment centers to be ready at or shortly after launch in the U.S., I would say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the status of those hub centers in Germany. The logic of the German physicians to say, well, we want to make sure that patients have access to commercial ROCTAVIAN before we push them through for companion diagnostic testing and the reality, which we knew was that German physicians would bear some financial responsibility potentially if they were prescribing and treating with ROCTAVIAN before these outcomes-based agreements supporting reimbursement were completed. So the way you can think about the guidance generally is the earlier we can get more of those German patients and then other European markets later in the year, fully on line, and then the earlier U.S. approval that we get that would push us towards the higher end of that guidance."
