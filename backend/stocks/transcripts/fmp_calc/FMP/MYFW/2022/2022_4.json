    "content": " On a year-over-year basis, our gross revenue increased 23.8% from the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to higher net interest income, resulting from both organic and acquisitive growth on our balance sheet. Your line is open. And it just feels to me like we're pretty well positioned from an already competitively high net interest margin compared to high fee bank peers, private banking peers, I think we're well positioned to see some growth later in the year but we're going to see that come down in Q1. So yes, I mean, I think we're well positioned to see growth in deposits and loans in those markets in relationships, but it's just hard to tell right now. So you'll probably see us dial back our residential mortgage production from what we did at least in the prior year for the first couple of quarters this year as we look at our competitors what they're pricing those loans at, they're not quite as attractive as what we would want to put on our portfolio. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I think higher fourth quarters than the prior three quarters is a good expectation whether we're going to hit the number next year like we did this year, I don't know. Your line is open. Your line is open. We've managed to produce another great year of solid organic growth in revenues and core earnings in spite of some significant headwinds, we're well positioned for the challenges that 2023 may bring and especially if some of those 2022 headwinds turn to tailwinds, and these challenges that we've seen become opportunities for us."
