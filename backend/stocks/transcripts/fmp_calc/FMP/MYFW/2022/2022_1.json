    "content": " We typically see some level of seasonality in the first quarter that impacts our level of loan production, which definitely occurred again this year, particularly in January and February, we\u2019ve also seen an increase in the competitive environment in our markets somewhat driven by new entrance in acquisition activity. Particularly ahead of the coming interest rate increases, we believe that we\u2019re best served by not putting low, long-term fixed rate loans on our balance sheet even if that costs us a bit in terms of loan growth and net interest income in the short-term. This momentum has continued and based on the current trends, we\u2019re seeing loan production \u2013 the trends we\u2019re seeing in loan production to start second quarter, we believe that we\u2019ll have good opportunities to redeploy our assets excess liquidity into higher yielding assets in the coming months. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing a higher level of loan production and to start the second quarter with the diverse lending platform, we have the ability to be flexible and pivot to whichever asset classes are seeing the strongest demand in presenting the most attractive risk adjusted opportunities at any given point in time. I know payoffs burden that number this quarter, I think in the past, we\u2019ve talked about kind of a mid teams level of loan growth kind of the near/longer term for y\u2019all. Well, I think the starting point has to be, a point that we\u2019ve made before Brady, which is we\u2019re just small enough that a change in the number of payoffs that we get in a quarter, like we saw in Q1 or the amount of loans that actually get funded in a quarter, just has an outsize impact on that quarter\u2019s reported number. And like you say, I mean we\u2019ve been carrying $500 million in the first quarter, mostly at a negative spread because even, that\u2019s a close to zero you\u2019re by the time you\u2019ve pay, you have to, I see insurance, you\u2019re getting zero on it. So excluding mortgage, which does seem to cause a little bit of variation depending on the type and mix of those, our yields are about improving and are about a little bit above 4% on the new loans that we\u2019ve put in the first quarter. I also think that our loan demand is high enough now that we have the luxury to have this pricing and discipline pricing in terms that I talked about, like if you\u2019re fighting for the last dollar growth, maybe that\u2019s harder to have the backbone, but I think with the amount of demand that we\u2019re seeing and the pipelines we\u2019re seeing and the success of our teams and producing these opportunities and maintaining price discipline through, the relationship things we\u2019ve talked about before, and it seems like we\u2019re able to do a good job of that and still grow. Our success in fact was probably neutral because of the liquidity that we already had, but for the longer term, I think that\u2019s going to be a really nice benefit, overall the only real pricing pressure we\u2019ve seen on deposits so far is about 260 million of our deposits are what we call trust cash, which is the cash that\u2019s maintained in trust and investment management balances here. So, if we just do some back of the envelope math, if you had $300 million of excess liquidity or to loan that out at 4% knock off 25% for taxes, that gives you roughly an extra dollar per share of earnings after the first quarter of origination, when, when you'd have your provision that would be associated with it, is that the essentially the right way to think about it, that there\u2019s another buck of earnings potential built into the business as you redeploy just the existing excess cash? The expense guidance kind of clean quarter after the DP conversion of 19.5 million to 21 million per quarter, that seemed like a rather large range to me, because on the low side or high side, it\u2019s a difference basically of like $0.45 a share. I mean, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s really proven that, but I do think 1.25 is a very achievable number for us, 1.5 seems like an achievable number, as we grow this thing out, depends on how many new offices we\u2019re opening, depends on how many new people we\u2019re hiring this quarter or next quarter. And so, we have our targeted list and we\u2019re working them and if they decide they want to sell, hopefully they\u2019ll be familiar with us as a really attractive buyer for them that has really good experience in successful acquisitions and being a really good partner post acquisition, which I think, our folks from Simmons would tell you from two years ago, our folks from EMC, the mortgage company would tell you from three years ago."
