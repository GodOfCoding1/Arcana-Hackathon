    "content": " In our E&P Technology and Services business, multiclient revenues improved sequentially, primarily due to starting our Mid North Sea High 3D multiclient program and an increase in 2D data library sales. In the last 5 years, our 3D data library has grown nearly 10,000% from approximately 4,000 square kilometers to 400,000 square kilometers today, with substantially all of the 3D investment in basins that are well positioned to support the E&P sector in the energy transition, such as the North Sea and offshore Brazil. E&P Technology & Services segment revenues of $12 million increased by 62% sequentially, primarily due to starting the second phase of our Mid North Sea High 3D multiclient program and an increase in 2D data library cells."
