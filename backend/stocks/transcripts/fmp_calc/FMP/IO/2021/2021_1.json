    "content": " Yes, it depends on which side of the business, but I\u2019d say on the data library business, if I picked one, we have a lot of investment in Brazil with all the reprocessing that\u2019s going on in a large number of the eight concurrent re-imaging programs that we\u2019ve had in the quarter are in Brazil, different phases of expanding our Kenya data product there. What we have been trying to do on all sides of the house are really leverage our existing competencies to penetrate new markets, whether it\u2019s going from 2D to 3D in the seismic sides, or whether that\u2019s moving our software into specific markets, like ports and offshore logistics and suchlike."
