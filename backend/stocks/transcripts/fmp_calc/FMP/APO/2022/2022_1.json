    "content": " In the market environment we saw in the first quarter with equity market volatility, rising rates and inflation, Athene\u2019s limited exposure to public equities and sizable allocation to strategic asset origination and retirement services platforms, as well as diversified credit, real estate and natural resource investments drove meaningful outperformance. For the first quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $310 million or $0.52 per share, which increased modestly year-over-year reflecting higher revenues and increased cost associated with investing in our business for growth as both Marc and Scott mentioned. Moving to our retirement services segment, we generated spread-related earnings of $670 million in the first quarter or $1.12 per share, driven by a net investment spread of 186 basis points and translating to a net spread of 148 basis points. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Maybe the first one, this is going to be a alternative investment portfolio, so, and just maybe digging a little bit deeper, with the 46% of the assets that are being in some type of platform whether it\u2019s the retirement services origination platforms, is it reasonable to think of the SRE from those or the earnings from those platforms just being actually pretty stable quarter-to-quarter over time. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
