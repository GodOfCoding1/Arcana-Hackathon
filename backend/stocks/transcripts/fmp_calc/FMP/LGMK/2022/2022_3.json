    "date": "2022-11-10 18:31:02",
    "content": " I am pleased to report that we achieved another strong quarter of solid revenue growth, up 15% in Q3 and 28% year-to-date, with higher gross profits and improved gross margins as we continue to execute across our initiatives and product development, operations, intellectual property expansion, sales and marketing. Direct operating costs in the third quarter were 346,000 increasing 51% over the year ago period, driven by higher sales and the initiation of online advertising to support the July 2022 launch of the company's new direct-to-consumer e-commerce Web site. Selling expenses in the third quarter increased to 333,000, up from 75,000 from the same period in the prior year, due to the addition of new personnel and higher sales commissions paid on the increase in sales."
