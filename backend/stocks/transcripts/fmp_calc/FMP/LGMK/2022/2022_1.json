    "content": " We will continue to communicate to our current 3G device customers to help them transition over to the various programs I mentioned a month ago, including direct mailings, additional customer support, continued media outreach, and of course, direct to veteran education programs, which included a 3G sunsetting resource center, FAQs, and an instructional video on how to check current LogicMark devices. We have structured our ESG efforts around three main themes; financial policy reviews and audits, in which we will continue to dedicate our resources to ensure we remediate the issues that had contributed to our potential delisting from the NASDAQ stock market last year, and then towards ongoing adherence to NASDAQ's governance guideline. We also have begun to conduct an energy and resources evaluation to determine if increased efficiencies are possible, including the expansion and improvement of domestic and international supply chain channels and a CO2 offset program are all under review to ensure we meet customer demand and that suppliers adhere to NASDAQ's recommended code of conduct."
