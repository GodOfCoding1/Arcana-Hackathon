Our Specialty Sports Group, SSG, delivered a 28.1% increase in sales compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to increased demand in our OEM channels. Moving to our Powered Vehicles Group, PVG, delivered a 20.9% increase in sales in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to strong performance in our upfitting product lines.

For the second quarter of 2022, non-GAAP adjusted gross margin increased by 120 basis points to 35.3% versus Q2 of 2021. The increase in gross margin and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin were primarily driven by favorable product mix compared to Q2 of 2021, led by higher volume sales in our Specialty Sports Group and strong performance in our upfitting product lines. Looking at non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 60 basis points to 16.3% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 15.7% in the same period in the prior year. Focusing on operating expenses in more detail, sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher commissions of $2.4 million. Research and development costs increased approximately $3 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to personnel investments to support future growth and product innovation. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to higher employee-related costs of $2.9 million as well as higher insurance and facility-related costs of $2.5 million.
