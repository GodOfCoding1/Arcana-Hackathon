    "content": " As Bradley just mentioned, the increased adjusted EBITDA that we experienced in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period last year was largely due to increased build rents in our Canadian lodges and increased Canadian mobile camp activity coupled with increased Australian village billed rooms and integrated services activity. Based on our third quarter results and the deferral of the majority of our Canadian mobile camp demobilization costs ended 2023, we are raising our full year 2022 revenue and EBITDA guidance to $675 million to $685 million revenues and $110 million to $115 million of adjusted EBITDA."
