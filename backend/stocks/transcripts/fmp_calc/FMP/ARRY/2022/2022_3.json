    "content": " As Kevin mentioned, the $400 million from the legacy Array business represents organic growth of 112% compared to the prior year and is reflective of both an increase in the number of megawatts shipped and an increase in ASP of approximately 30%. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we still expect $100 million of free cash flow for the full year, inclusive of $12 million to $15 million of capital spend. And then if I just take the $75 million to $100 million and then also you sort of down ticking the STI a bit at the high end, it seems like you're still seeing growth relative to the original guidance. And I think you're seeing that coupled with, as we've really focused our operations teams on improving our linearity of business, it's allowed us to ship more and reduce the overall backlog in the business by just really hitting a very high level of linearity. As Kevin mentioned and I did as well, we've had really good linearity of our shipments throughout the quarter and we've done that purposely really, is to really save space at the end of the quarter for certain projects that the customers did want delivered that we were able to do because we don't have a hockey stick work."
