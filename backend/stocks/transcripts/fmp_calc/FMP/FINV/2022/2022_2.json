During the second quarter, we served over 500,000 small business owners across a variety of industries such as wholesale, retail and manufacturing, among others, representing an increase of 23% from the same period of 2021. Transaction volume for this segment further increased to 68% year-over-year to a new record high of RMB10.4 billion, contributing 25% of total transaction volume in the second quarter. With a large number of better quality borrowers in our Indonesia business, our proportion of loans funded by local institutional partner also increased to 39% from 14% in the previous quarter, and from no institutional funding in the same period last year. We can already see that we have completed the transition, for example, in the second quarter, although our transaction volume growth is only 6%, but our outstanding loan balance has increased by 33% quarter-on-quarter. And with a larger number of superior quality borrowers in Indonesia, the proportion of loans funded by local institutional partners increased to 39% compared to 14% in the previous quarter. And in the third quarter, we expect transaction volume to be around 1.1 billion, up 20% quarter-over-quarter and outstanding loan balance to increase around 40%. And in the second quarter of 2022, our average loan pricing is around 24.2% in terms of transaction volume."
