    "content": " Finally, our onsite managed services revenue totaled $70 million, representing a year-over-year decline of 10% for the quarter. But just on the quick math, we said that a 10% increase to our prior year\u2019s costs would be about $600,000 to $700,000 ish of increased costs. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not even the nature of the kind of conversation we have with customers, because consider what the alternative is, it would be to do it themselves, which would be to hire the bodies, employ a direct model and have their costs go up 15% to 25% or more in that rising cost environment that they experience."
