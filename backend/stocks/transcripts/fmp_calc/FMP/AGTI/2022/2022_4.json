    "content": " As we move to the first half of this year, we'll lap the prior year's benefits from COVID-19 and the HHS contract renewal and we expect our back half results to more clearly demonstrate the predictable, organic growth of our base business. In the first quarter of 2022, they represented tailwind benefits to our reported results and in the second half of the year, we experienced short term headwinds related to the COVID impacted lower than expected utilization of our rental device fleet and the timing delays associated with the renewal of the HHS contract. Excluding the favorable impact from COVID in the prior year, which was estimated at $12 million to $15 million, revenue in Q4 2022 increased 2% over the prior year. A reminder that when comparing year-over-year performance for Q4 in the prior year period, we estimated a favorable impact from COVID driven device demand of approximately $12 million to $15 million, which primarily impacted equipment solutions. Overall, excluding the onetime impact described above and contributions from M&A our guidance implies low to mid single digit organic revenue growth in 2023, which is weighted toward the second half of the year as we continue to onboard new business.
