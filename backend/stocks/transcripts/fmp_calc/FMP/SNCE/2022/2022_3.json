    "content": " From a fourth quarter-to-date standpoint, we have signed approximately $20 million in gross bookings, including one contract greater than $10 million. Your line is open. So I guess like maybe just on the third quarter bookings, you had mentioned basically falling short on some delays in expected contract signings and longer sales cycles, which was something you had cited last quarter as you'd focus on larger engagements. Your line is open. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in terms of the net bookings that we reported in the third quarter of $4.7 million, we had approximately $8 million of primarily scope reductions, a couple of small cancellations in there. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. From a quality standpoint, one of the strong things about the value proposition is that through the entire Science 37 network, we're operationalizing everything through one unified platform with one set of procedure SOPs and a standardized set of people that are delivering across the whole thing, which really mitigates the risk of a disparate network of individual sites that have their own people processes and technology in order to be able to deliver and you're trying to tie all those together through monitoring."
