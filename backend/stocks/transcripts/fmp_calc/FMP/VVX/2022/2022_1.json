    "content": " Revenue guidance remains at $1.82 billion to $1.86 billion, reflecting year-on-year growth of 2% to 4% with the accelerated phase-in of LOGCAP V and Kwajalein, successful start-up at Fort Benning, remediation efforts in Hawaii and work supporting the Air Force in Europe, we are tracking towards the high end of guidance on revenue. Pro forma revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the combined business is approximately $3.6 billion and $290 million, which includes $20 million of previously disclosed run rate synergies. I can move to other contracts like the spectrum work that we had just talked about today, like the AFCAP work which is addressing additional contingency operations globally as well as the continued string of wins we've had in the Navy as a way to demonstrate that we continue, I believe, to be very successful in both the protection of our base and new wins in not only LOGCAP but across the various areas in the operational space that we support."
