    "content": " If you look at larger financings like something larger like over $1.5 billion in secured lending right now, I mean that is really probably \u2013 you start paying pretty meaningful premiums over SOFR to get financings in that kind of range. I guess what I\u2019d maybe have you think about is if you go back to our last quarterly call, we talked about this concept that there were portfolio premiums out there like hard to compete, because financing was so aggressive and that was \u2013 they are just putting a lot of pressure on cap rates for us. I think it\u2019s going to be higher when we get all said and done for this year, it will be closer to somewhere in the 6.5% to 7% range, the entire $1.5 billion. I\u2019ll tell you like from my personal standpoint, it\u2019s interesting once you ask, if there were no change to our cost of capital, i.e., if rates were still low, one of the things that was kind of interesting for me, as it relates to our pipeline process, acquisition pipeline process, is I think sometimes we can get a little bit isolated from the market."
