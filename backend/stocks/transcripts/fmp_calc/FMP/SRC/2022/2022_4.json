    "content": " Our disposition program also produced great results in the fourth quarter, we sold 21 occupied properties for $110.2 million at a 6.22% weighted average cash capitalization rate, representing a positive 93 basis point spread for a capital deployment cap rate and resulting in a $33.3 million gain. For the year, we sold 278 million of leased assets at a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 5.47%, representing a 118 basis points spread for capital deployment cap rate and generating a $94.2 million gain. And one of the reasons I think we're seeing that success is as I said, corporations are looking at their real estate, especially in industrial companies, monetizing it for long-term financing, just given kind of where non-investment-grade companies get trade today. And I think the other thing that you'll see this year for us, if you look last year, we did about 100, I think it's like 114 million of CapEx in development. I mean, the opportunity set that we see is still there, but we don't think it makes sense, obviously, keep acquiring in a $1 billion-plus rate given our current cost of capital and we think we'll get -- it will be better for shareholders for us to kind of prove out all of the deals that we've transacted are really good, which we believe they are."
