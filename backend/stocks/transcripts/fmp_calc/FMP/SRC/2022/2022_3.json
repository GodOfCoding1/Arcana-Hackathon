    "content": " We partially funded these acquisitions with $74 million of disposition proceeds, predominantly from the sale of leased retail assets with a weighted average cash capitalization rate of 5.7%, resulting in net capital deployment of $194 million at a blended cash yield of 7.29%. Looking back even further, since the spin-off of SMTA in 2018, we have increased our ABR by 82% to $661 million, growing our industrial rents by $108 million, increased our wallet to 10.4 years and raised our public tenant exposure to 53%. So I think as we look out to try to think about our disposition plan, we think smaller is better, smaller granular assets are easier to finance right now, because the other buyers, the non-1031 buyers were generally to high net worth individuals that probably paid all cash for these properties and there were some small funds that we were able to engage with and sell property, too. But I think many of us are trying to get a sense if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasonable to think of the third quarter, the $250 million as a good run rate given the elevated cost of capital and debt pricing and the shift in the market. So I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would just say like there is a lot of companies that need capital and they are obviously kind of like, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do a sale leaseback. I think as you look at the pipeline going forward, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably looking more like that, smaller bite-size opportunities, not really larger assets."
