    "content": " During Q1 2022 in partnerships with Atmosic, an emerging leader in low power BLE devices, we announced an IoT wirelessly charge sensor evaluation kit, which includes a 1W PowerBridge Atmosic\u2019s ATM three receivers, which is expected to become available in Q2 2022. Also announced this quarter, Syntiant is a new partner whose low powered neural decision processors for artificial intelligence represents the addition of next generation, high performance yet low power, consuming IoT devices at the network edge with new data processing capabilities. By using Energous WattUp PowerBridge technology, Syntiant\u2019s sound processing adds a new generation of smart IoT devices which can react and control IoT devices deployed in retail, industrial, home and office environments. Excluding 0.8 million of stock compensation expense and 0.1 million of depreciation expense from our total Q1 GAAP costs and expenses of $7.4 million, net non-GAAP costs and expenses totaled approximately $6.5 million, approximately $0.3 million less than the $6.2 million total non-GAAP costs and expenses in the prior quarter and approximately even compared to the same quarter last year."
