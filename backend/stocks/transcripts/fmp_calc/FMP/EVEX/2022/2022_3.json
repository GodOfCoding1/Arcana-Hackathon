    "content": " Now with the BNDES line, we're even stronger from a cash perspective with Eve's total liquidity above $400 million, which compared to our cash burn around $100 million to $150 million per year gives us enough cash for multiple years of our eVTOL development. So as I said, it's a great support from the Brazilian Development Bank, almost $100 million, very long-term, and it creates a lot of value for our shareholders, then combined very well, with the $400 million we raised in equity in our IPO in May. And now we are bringing these additional finance company BNDES that gives us north of $400 million in liquidity, which is multiple years of off cash compared to our projected investments in the eVTOL development."
