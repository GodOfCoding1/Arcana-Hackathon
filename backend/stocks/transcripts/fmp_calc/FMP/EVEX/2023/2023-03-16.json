This is Lucio Aldworth, the Director of Investor Relations at Eve, and I wanted to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. I have here with me co-CEOs, Gerard DeMuro and Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Stein as well as our CFO, Eduardo Couto. After their initial remarks, we're going to open the call for questions. We have prepared a deck with a few slides and additional information, and this is available at our Investor Relations website at ir.eveairmobility.com. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, general economic, political and business conditions, both in Brazil and in our market. The words believe, may, will, estimate, continues, anticipates, intends, expects and similar words are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any statement because of new information, future events or other factors. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this presentation might not occur. With that, I will now turn the presentation over to Jerry. Good morning, and thank you to those joining the call today as well. We had a very eventful 2022, accomplishing a number of milestones for the program and for the company. We, as many of you know, are actually a product of Embraer's technology accelerator, EmbraerX, and the first eVTOL concept was actually introduced in and being developed in EmbraerX in 2018. And we were then spun out and eventually, we merged with Zanite and went public in May of last year. Going public, Eve now has the autonomy and agility of a start-up, yet the resources and experience and the backing of Embraer, so that we feel we can be a major player in the OEM market. We listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol EVEX last May, and we listed with net proceeds of about $355 million from the de-SPAC that included investments from our PIPE investors as well as United, which came along later in September. Later in the year, we secured almost another $100 million worth of credit lines with the Brazilian National Development Bank. You will recall that operating with our critical mass, mostly in Brazil, gives us tremendous OpEx and CapEx advantages. Thus, we think we'll be well set through the R&D program again through 2025. We're refining the final design, not only through the use of these advanced engineering tools, but we're also using subscale models and advancing to full-scale commercially representative prototypes eventually in 2024. We are following an effective and efficient process proven over many years by Embraer, which has certified more aircraft in the last 25 years than any other aviation OEM. Our goal, of course, is a safe and reliable eVTOL with the lowest total cost of ownership, and that's what drove us to a Lift + Cruise configuration that is truly optimized for the urban air mission. We had great reviews, and it will also be available at our investor event this April in Melbourne, Florida. We also initiated our Type Certification process in 2022, which will be done through ANAC, the Brazilian Aviation Authority. While the Type Certification will be done through ANAC in Brazil, it will also be followed by FAA to a bilateral agreement that ANAC and FAA have had for many years. And typically, this allows a much more efficient process with only limited additional testing and final endorsement of the certification process by FAA. We also began dialogue with EASA, and we intend to follow a similar approach there. But we think we have a significant advantage by being first in line with ANAC and using ANAC as our primary certification authority versus, for instance, multiple applicants at the FAA, all with unique configuration. In 2022, we also ran a number of simulations with helicopters in Rio, in Chicago and most recently in India. Now to the next slide, I'd like to call my Co-CEO, Andre Stein, to talk a little bit more about the program advancements in the last quarter. We shortlisted potential suppliers of critical systems, such as motors and batteries, and now have more detailed visibility as to the certifications of these components. With that, we can fine-tune our development, refine our flight-control laws, performance envelope, fly-by-wire systems and so on. In parallel, we have been employing dedicated motor-propeller rigs to test under different conditions and other rigs for batteries and other components and systems. This part of our approach were test systems and components independently and incorporate them in our design, optimizing the configuration. But besides having defined that the first production site to be in Brazil, which we announced late last year, we have concluded our manufacturing strategy with the support of Porsche to define model size, flow management and other logistics related specifically to the manufacturing process. Lastly, we defined the system requirement for the Urban Air Traffic Management software and successfully deployed an earlier version in our Chicago simulation last September. In the end, our strengths translate into the largest and most diversified backlog by number of customers and regions in the industry today. In total, we have nonbinding LOIs, that these are letters of intent, for 2,770 aircraft from 26 different customers spread over 12 countries and different business from to regional airlines to helicopter operators, ridesharing platforms and leasing companies. We believe this pipeline offers strong long-term revenue visibility, and it will help Eve to smooth cash flow consumption in the years to come as we start to convert the existing letters of intention into firm orders and collect predelivery payments, known as PDPs. Beyond that, we are developing a strong network of partners in areas, such as infrastructure and energy, addressing one of the largest challenges ahead of Urban Air Mobility, which is creating a whole new ecosystem beyond simply developing aircraft. At Slide 5, Eve is a pre-operational company formed to develop its eVTOL in the Urban Air Mobility ecosystem. We expect to start to generate material revenues outside of predelivery payments once we start to deliver our eVTOLs, currently estimated for 2026. We are the only eVTOL company with a complete solution, including the aircraft, maintenance and air traffic control. In addition to R&D, we also deployed $9 million in SG&A during the quarter and $33 million in the year. Including R&D and SG&A, we reported a net loss of $20 million in the quarter and $174 million in the year. This nonrecurring, noncash expenses were $111 million, so recurring loss for the full year of 2022 was $63 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $311 million in total liquidity, down from $330 million in the third quarter of 2022 without considering the recent long-term funding from the Brazilian Development Bank. Considering our current cash position, investments, including with Embraer and the credit lines from the Brazilian Development Bank currently signing, we have total liquidity of more than $400 million. Again, we feel comfortable that this is enough to carry our operations, development and certification efforts through 2025. We have full access to 1,500 identified and skilled engineers from Embraer on a first priority and as-needed basis. This means we don't need to bring hundreds of engineers into our P&L, which helps reduce our development costs. On top of that, most of our team is located in Brazil, where we have specialized engineers and more favorable cost rate. In the end, our R&D dollars last longer in Brazil compared to U.S. and Europe, where our competitors are located. Lastly, we also have access to Embraer's facilities, reducing investments related to infrastructure and CapEx in general. As Stein mentioned, our R&D efforts are intensifying. For 2023, we expect Eve's total cash consumption to be between $130 million and $150 million, which, considering our total liquidity above $400 million gives us good comfort to keep our eVTOL development in the years to come. With that, I conclude our financial highlights, and I would like to call Stein to talk about our development milestones. During 2022, one of our focus was to put the necessary structures in place, engage the right people and fund the development and certification program for our aircraft as well as other products for the Urban Air Mobility market. With funding now secured, we are accelerating our program as planned with the milestones you see on Slide 7. The first, as I alluded to earlier, is the selection of the primary suppliers of the most critical components of our aircraft, such as propulsion systems and batteries, which will be completed in the first half of 2023. Also defined the suppliers, we continue to refine and validate our estimates for aircraft production, performance envelope and operating costs. The selection will also result in much more detailed specifications of these components, such as dimensions, weight, power output and the systems interface. This is critical for us to define the final aircraft architecture at a complete system level, which we plan to also accomplish in the first semester of this year. With the final design established, we expect to begin fabrication of our prototype as planned in 2023. Last but not least, we plan to deploy the most recent version of our Urban Air Traffic Management in the second half to start testing in field trials with potential customers. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we'd like to open for the call for questions. As you know, we came from a strong aviation background. As any aviation company, we do not disclose beforehand dates for first flights. One, it's to assure that safety, it is the ultimate goal. And the second is that our goal is and will continue to be the end goal to certify, develop and deliver the aircraft. So we are not disclosing first dates or first flights, but what I can say that we are on track according to the plan. We will start the assembly and manufacturing of the prototype this year, as we mentioned. And we will start by  when at the right time, again, following our plan to assure the -- our entry to the service and entry to the market are sure our final goal. We believe a lot and having been done that in several previous programs to develop the things in right order, not necessarily not bring forward some of the most visible aspects of the development, but to really assure that we're always maturing and moving ahead with the parts of the problem, the different parts of the problem. Andre, if I could add one thing. We're flying subscale models, doing a lot of model simulation, proof of concepts. And as we select, as Stein had said, as we select our vendors here, we can refine our models. And actually, when we fly, \"what you're defining as a prototype,\" it will be as close to representative of the vehicle we intend to take into certification as we can possibly make it. Subscale models, proof of concept vehicles and then something that we think is fairly representative of what we're going to take forward. So that's why the progression through the second half of this year after we define our critical suppliers, as Stein alluded to, we'll make -- we'll refine that design, and that's what we intend to fly -- begin assembling at the end of the year and fly next. On the liquidity side, right, so now $310.6 million as of Q4, including the lines of credit, total liquidity north of $400 million. Is the expectation -- I know you've mentioned today that you believe that, that current liquidity is sufficient to fund operations designs and certifications into 2025. But the last part of your question, I think I can answer. But the R&D efforts through 2025, we should have sufficient funding to get through that. And as we mentioned, we expect to consume this year between $130 million to $150 million. So we are not concerned at all about the liquidity, and we feel very good. Yes, Andre, one thing I would add to that. We have not yet begun to calculate into those liquidity figures, predelivery payments or progress payments, if you will, as we work through the definitization of the LOIs that Stein referred to. And -- so again, we feel pretty good about getting through the first steps of certification. So if you look at our previous programs, typically, it's around 18 months for certification flight test campaign. So I was referring to our previous experience, right, so from previous programs that typically what you see. In this case, as Jerry mentioned, we are doing more. So we have been trying proof-of-concept, we have been doing a subscale models, and we brought the flight-control laws, flight stimulator earlier on in the process. So there are different steps there, but that's what we've seen in other programs. So on that, I think one of -- one very expressive milestone is actually the selection of the suppliers that we intend to do this year. That's when we will have a more clear view on the actual costs, actual cost of the aircraft, and that will put us in a much better position to start firming orders. So Savi, just to complement what Stein has said, as we move through this year, we will be identifying not only in refining the final configuration now that we have supplier data -- the final supplier data, but we will also be working with some of our partners and identifying the launch customers. And then naturally, as you progress through the certification milestones, there would be additional payments prior to delivery. And one more point just to complement on that last line, Jerry. I mean we have this big portfolio of customers, and we are working very closely with them to refine how the operation will be, what will be the necessary aspects of the operation, necessary infrastructure,  and so on. We are not expecting to see a big increase in headcount with  as we are, as you know, using Embraer for the majority of the development. Typically, we'd expect to have around 800 people altogether at peaks. The big jump is really on R&D, right, or the increase is the majority in R&D from the $130 million to $150 million this year, around $100 million should be fully dedicated to R&D. Of course, we have the Eve structure and the development team in some other areas that the remaining $30 million to $40 million. Well, I'll turn it over to Stein in a moment. Given that you're dealing with aviation, you may have typical suppliers, as you've seen in our partner list, partners like technology partners like Thales and Rolls-Royce and even BAE. They are typical suppliers in aviation, but the equipment here would be unique. And we are in the down select right now for the major suppliers, we call and Stein has been intricately involved in that on a daily basis, and that includes things like the power management, battery systems, the motors, the propellers and then moving to avionics. No, I think you mentioned it. That said, of course, you can leverage a lot of existing Embraer relations. Also, there are newcomers to the market when you're talking about electrification and so on. So there are new players in this aerospace market, it's great, but creates more of a level field. And we -- throughout the year, we are selecting the majors, as Jerry said, but also we are moving on with the selection of other aspects, like flight-controls, like even interiors, everything that needs to be in place this year so we can have a very, very significant portion of both the cost of the product as well as all the technical aspects over. So just wondering you guys already have a very sizable book of orders, intention of purchase. If you guys are like actively marketing the product as you reach the new milestone, we should see new orders going through the book. And also, I mean, related to that question is, who do you think are the, let's say, the easiest clients to get the eVTOL, just to think about the ramp-up that you have forecasted on your -- let's say, on your IPO. So to your point, yes, we are continuing with our sales campaign. Also, we are strongly engaged with the existing customers we have on our backlog to really deep dive on understanding how the concept of operations will be. All this exercise will be done related to concept of operations, simulations and so on, to help us to understand the needs. So we can bring not only the customers, but the infrastructure partners and energy providers to the table and to the discussion to assure that we are -- from the market perspective, we can have that deployment. Yes, we are continuing to talk of diverse portfolio of the customers beyond the ones we already acquired, but there is also a strong focus on engaging with existing customers and developing this plan. On top of that, as you know, last year, we've worked together with Porsche to understand the requirements for manufacturing, how we can ramp up the production, how we can do that in a rational way as well. There is an optimum there, how much you want to ramp up and still be able to support and serve these aircrafts in a very professional, very complete way. So we don't need to reinvest from scratch on existing infrastructure, and we're being present in over 80 countries around the globe. There is, as I said before, in terms of dates for flight test campaign, we don't disclose that ahead of time for all the reasons I've explained. Yes, that's a good question. Yes, the development expenses are included on the cost on the guidance that Eduardo said. But as we've said as well, we are planning to deploy earlier versions this year with potential customers, and we actually have around 6 customers already today for the software. We've deployed earlier version last year in September during our trials in Chicago, again, to fine-tune the software development. With the software development, we are using and engaging with ATAC, which is part of the Embraer Group that has been developed that type of software not only for the Brazilian aerospace, so that they basically develop the whole software here for the Brazilian aerospace, but as well for other countries. And yes, it is included in our predicted expense for this year. Edu, not sure, if you're going to comment on the last bit. You talked about the advantage, your advantage on the certification process relative to the multiple applicants at the FAA. And I wondered if you could elaborate on that point and also just provide some additional perspective on how you see the industry having evolved in recent months with respect not only to the whole issue of certification, but also in terms of design, maybe proof of concept and manufacturing strategies. Obviously, in terms of higher interest rates and some other respects, the environment has gotten somewhat more challenging. Let me kick it off, and then we'll turn it over to the team. We have a number of strategic partners, as you know. As you know, when we came out of our listing, we had a very, very clean balance sheet, and we're able to be opportunistic and look at the most cost-effective ways to get the capital that is required. And again, we have the luxury of significant time and allow the situations to mature and be opportunistic. With respect to the FAA, the comment really is that whether it's ANAC or FAA, they have to develop or combine existing requirements from different parts of the regulations today and that will take some time. There's only a certain number of expert in these areas, whether they be an FAA or ANAC. And as you have multiple applicants, they may find that there's a resource constraint in processing. In terms of the industry maturing, you have early phases as you do in any industry where some are better capitalized than others. Some designs will be more effective than others, and I think you're just seeing a natural evolution in that regard. And realistically, there was a point in this industry, there was a lot of hype. At a certain point, you were talking about 200 different projects for eVTOLs and so on. On the liquidity side, we are not anticipating any new equity. Just a couple for me, kind of building on previous questions. In terms of the PDPs, of course, we are highly engaged with all our customers' rights to define  define the potential skyline of deliveries and refine all these orders. We may start to see something in 2024,, definitely going higher in '25 and '26. But we are fully engaged with our partners, right, our customers, and we believe that could be an interesting cash inflow to the company that today we are not considering . Well, on the second piece, Marvin, yes, we expect to add some strategic customers, but if you look at our backlog and our business plan, we really have enough coverage there in the LOIs for the first several years of production. And as Stein talked about, we want to be able to support and service not only the aircraft, but support operations on a global basis, and we're recognizing, again, that there's likely to be dispersed implementation and adoption and that has to be resourced properly. It's about strategy and now defining, as Stein talked about, launch customers, launch cities, and what is the total plan to support launch in those cities. No, I think you covered it. Yes, we might expect to see additional customers, but our main focus is -- we are in a comfortable position in terms of pipeline and backlog that we can put a lot of focus on assuring how the deployment will be. One, that we're already doing actually, it is even on consulting about Management and the concept of operations. So we are actually generating some revenue already on that, even before the actual software development. That's already an outcome on all the -- it's small -- really still at this point, really small revenue, but it's already there. But that's already an outcome of the work we've done in developing, creating this blueprint in terms of concept of operations. We can expect that to increase in the years to come, to have -- continues to do that work together with partners in terms of developing the Air Traffic Management ecosystem as a whole. And with the software itself a few years down the road before, but even before the entry into service of the aircraft, keep in mind that the software is agnostic. It's not at the same scale as particularly the aircraft service and aircraft sales, but it is very strategic, and that's how you're seeing it. It is -- again, it is agnostic. But in terms of scale, yes, it's really when the industry starts to grow, that could expect more sizable revenue out of it. Thank you, Shamali, and thanks, everyone, who joined the call today. If you have any questions, as always, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."
