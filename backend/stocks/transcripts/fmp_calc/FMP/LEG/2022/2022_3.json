    "content": " Sales in the quarter were down 2% versus third quarter 2021, primarily from lower volume and currency impact, partially offset by raw material-related price increases. EBIT decreased 21% versus third quarter 2021, primarily from lower volume, lower overhead absorption from reduced production and operational inefficiencies in specialty phone, partially offset by metal margin expansion. Volume declines from soft demand in U.S. and European bedding markets, along with currency impacts, were partially offset by raw material-related selling price increases and trade sales growth in our Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses. EBITDA margins in the segment were lower versus third quarter 2021, primarily from lower volume and lower overhead absorption as production levels were adjusted to meet reduced demand and operational efficiencies in Specialty Phone, which are being addressed by continuing integration work. Sales in our Specialized Products segment increased 24% versus third quarter 2021 from strong volume growth in all 3 businesses, raw material-related price increases and to Pacoma acquisition in late August. Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were flat with third quarter 2021 as raw material-related selling price increases and higher volume in Geo Components and Work Furniture were offset by lower volume in home furniture, flooring and fabric converting and currency impact. In the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $65 million, up $15 million as compared to $50 million in third quarter 2021, reflecting a much smaller use of cash for working capital, partially offset by lower earnings. The decrease versus second quarter guidance primarily reflects lower expected volume, reduced production, slower-than-anticipated cost recovery in automotive and operational inefficiencies in Specialty Phone."
