    "content": " 2022 EBIT was $485 million, a decrease of $111 million versus 2021 EBIT and a decrease of $83 million versus 2021 adjusted EBIT, primarily from lower volume, lower overhead absorption from reduced production, operational inefficiencies in specialty foam, and higher raw material and transportation costs and operational inefficiencies in automotive. EBIT decreased 40% versus fourth quarter 2021, primarily from lower volume and lower overhead absorption as we intentionally cut production in our Steel Rod business below demand to reduce inventory levels. Versus last year, we're starting to expect -- well, we are expecting and experiencing some modest decline in overall metal margin, especially compared to the first part of last year when the conflict in Ukraine, and just overall market capacity constraints really drove things up higher in the first part of the year. But I would just remind to the folks that if we look at the forecast for major market production in 2023 is about 70 million vehicles just below that, improving back in 2019, which is actually a down year, it's still $75 million. We talked about how we work through the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter to bring down inventory levels, to align with the slower demand and taking they can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a lot of time out of the rod mill was painful from a margin standpoint, but it certainly got us to the right place in our cash flow and from an inventory standpoint."
