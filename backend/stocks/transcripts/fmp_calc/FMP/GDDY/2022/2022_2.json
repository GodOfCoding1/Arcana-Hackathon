    "content": " GoDaddy's resiliency and durable top line growth, profitability at scale and robust cash flow are evident in our Q2 financial results and enable GoDaddy to continue to invest to deliver long-term value while returning excess capital to investors in the form of share buybacks. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.67 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year cash flow per share of $4.78, a 19% increase on strong cash flow and share repurchases. Assuming a continuation of today's rates, over the rest of the year, we expect that the adverse FX impact for the full year to be approximately $35 million or approximately 1%, compared to our full year revenue guidance issued in February. We remain focused on driving strong financial results, and are committed to delivering $1.1 billion, in unlevered free cash flow and $6 plus free cash flow per share, as laid out earlier this year. The adverse FX impact to the range assuming continuation of today's rates, would be approximately $10 million or 1% flowing through this impact, we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 13% and 15%, and core platform revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. We are laser focused on operational execution and we are dedicated to delivering 10% plus top line CAGR, 15% plus normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR through 2024. Mark, please go ahead. Mark, please go ahead."
