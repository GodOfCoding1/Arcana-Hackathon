    "content": " Constant currency revenue growth was 9% compared to Q2 of 2021 this quarter, putting us at a 10% constant currency revenue growth in the first half of the year. More specifically, on a constant currency basis, comparing to Q2 -- when we compare Q2 of 2022 to Q2 of 2021, stent grafts grew 23%, On-X grew 12%, tissue processing grew 7%. As we expected, BioGlue revenue in the second quarter decreased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to delays in securing our CE Mark renewal as well as tough comps in the North America market for BioGlue in the first half of 2021. For stent grafts, revenues in the second quarter increased 23% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter last year. For On-X, we posted 12% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter -- in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. I'm pleased to report they were continuing to execute very well on the strategy as demonstrated by second quarter constant currency revenue growth of 38% and 59% in Asia Pacific and Latin America, respectively. Total revenues were $80.3 million for the second quarter, up 6% on a GAAP basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis, both compared to the second quarter of 2021. On a year-over-year basis, in the second quarter of 2022, aortic stent graft revenues increased 13%, On-X revenues increased 10% and tissue processing revenues increased 7%, reflecting new product launches and improving procedure volumes relative to the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, compared to the second quarter of 2021, aortic stent graft revenues increased 23%, On-X revenues increased 12%, tissue processing revenues increased 7%, and BioGlue revenues decreased 9%. On a regional basis, second quarter 2022 revenues in Asia Pacific increased 37%, Latin America increased 69%, North America increased 5% and Europe decreased 4%, all compared to the second quarter of 2021. On a constant currency basis, revenues in Asia Pacific increased 38%, Latin America increased 59%, North America increased 5% and Europe increased 6%, all compared to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding nonrecurring acquisition-related and business development benefits of $3.1 million in 2022, which primarily consists of a noncash $3.2 million benefit related to fair value adjustments for Ascyrus contingent consideration and rebranding charges of $289,000, and excluding nonrecurring acquisition and business development charges of $3.4 million in 2021, G&A expenses were $41.8 million for the second quarter of '22 compared to $37.4 million in the second quarter of '21."
