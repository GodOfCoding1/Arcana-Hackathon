    "content": " So, with respect to Integrated Gas, Oswald, where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at that, so if I take a step back so and think through, we tend to look, as you well know, on our Integrated Gas business as being pretty much second to none. Dan, may we have the next one, please? And therefore, what you have seen us do is to really concentrate our footprint to, first of all, fewer refineries but then moreover, turn those refineries into integrated energy and chemical parks, so that indeed, we are still being exposed to the Refining margin, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, at the same time, also using these as springboards for growth, diversification of products and of course, also as the platform upon which we will build our low carbon fuels business, our hydrogen business, et cetera, et cetera. Dan, may we have the next one, please? And as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said in other fora as well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long time since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had so many and so many good discussions with governments who, for a long time, of course, have taken certainly the availability but maybe also the affordability of energy as a given and had a somewhat singular focus on one side of the trilemma, taking together for granted."
