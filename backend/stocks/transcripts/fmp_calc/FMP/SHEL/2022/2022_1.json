    "content": " First one, actually wanted to start with the observation, looking at your underlying cash flow of $22 billion, you\u2019re generating more free cash flow this quarter than your two U.S. competitors combined. But what I would say, of course, is trading plays an integrative part in our results always and it hits across all of the different elements, whether that\u2019s in upstream wards, looking at how we off-take from the likes of Brazil, whether it\u2019s an integrated gas, which of course, you\u2019ve heard Wael talk about, but also in our RES business as well, where we\u2019ve talked about, of course, some of the pipeline gas moving through and the power sales. So making sure we\u2019re very-focused on where we spend that money and, of course, keeping within the capital discipline that we talked about before, of $23 billion to $27 billion. Beyond that, then if we take it to our shareholders, and we talk about that as well, as you can see, we\u2019ve said that we expect in the second half of this year to be distributing in excess of 30% of our CFFO, but at the same time, of course, there\u2019s also the progressive dividends that we have going through as well. So, this is going to be for the next few years, an area where we are building the foundation that hopefully is going to generate the sort of returns, the sorts of cash flow contributions that we expect towards the latter part of the decade where it becomes, I think, much more of a meaningful contribution in the bigger scheme of things, but very proud of what the team has done and pleased with the trajectory that they\u2019re on. What I would say, of course, is we\u2019ve already done $4 billion of the $8.5 billion for the first half that we talked about doing in terms of buybacks."
