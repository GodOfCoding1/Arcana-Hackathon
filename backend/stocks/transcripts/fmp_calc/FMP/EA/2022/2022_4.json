    "content": " FIFA Mobile recorded its biggest quarter ever, with unique new players surging nearly 80% year-over-year, and Apex Legends is amongst the top live service games in the industry. We've just had our biggest year ever for EA SPORTS FIFA games, building on nearly 30 years of connected experiences for players across more than 150 million unique accounts. We expect fiscal '23 net bookings to be $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% versus FY '22, driven by growth in live services, particularly in mobile, and supported by the strong launch slate in the second half. But I think as you -- as the franchise continues to grow and as we move on mobile and launch and grow on a global basis, I think it's reasonable to believe that over the course of time, there will be more and more content launched into the world and a new season starting today, which off the back of a record season 12, we expect will continue to do well. From a market standpoint, from the composition of our business, I think this is one of the things that really sort of illustrates the resilience of the live services business model, which with 71% of our business -- or over 71% of our business in FY '22, and it will grow as a share of our business next year with -- especially with the launches of mobile. And at any given point in time, based on what's going on in the world of that game and in this case, in the world of football and of the gameplay community, we will look to leverage new content and new events and new experiences either to drive greater engagement and provide new interesting things for players to do or it might be a monetization opportunity."
