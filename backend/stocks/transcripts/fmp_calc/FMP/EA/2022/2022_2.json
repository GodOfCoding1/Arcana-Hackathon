    "content": " And we never quite know exactly what we're going to get out of test markets, but we're very pleased with the progress so far, which means we could bring it out earlier, but I would say that most of it is really focused on next year, which we think is a positive since this year is so strong. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position and I think for us the biggest opportunity is, and this is an obvious one and that is, how do we take our existing sports licensors and the talent that the Glu's and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through that talent base and -- or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. So, part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle, and having 0.5, billion implied in our network engaging deeper in the experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio and we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise-to-franchise. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as the leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of Mobile -first talent on global portfolio of IP, a network of half a billion players and global reach."
