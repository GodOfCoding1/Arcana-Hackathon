    "content": " Solid execution, supported by ongoing demand for our products and services resulted in total revenue for the third quarter of $635 million compared to $608.7 million in the prior quarter. Obviously, it's a pretty quickly changing demand environment, especially -- 2023, one of your large customers last week predicted WFE could be down north of 20% year-on-year to the low $70 billion range. The total capacity of that fab -- our factory when it's up and running will be $600 million to $800 million, probably won't need all of that next year, but it's been ramping pretty well."
