    "content": " Looking back on this extraordinary three-year industry ramp, UCT's annual revenue grew almost 123% and earnings per share surged 243%. The strong demand we saw in the first three quarters of 2022 led to a record revenue of $2.4 billion for the year, up 13% from the prior year. We're obviously hopeful that the second half could be more positive as some of our customers and peers have commented that they're looking to see if there's something improves in the second half, but our assumption at this time is bouncing around the number that you put out there and some recovery in the second quarter, assuming that the supplier that's impacting us and many people right now is able to recover as well. For years leading up to this last up cycle, where the demand without stripping the supply for everyone in the industry, we were -- that's when we were seeing a very unusual fourth quarter bookings that was pretty easy to forecast. If we're thinking about revenue down roughly 25% or about $600 million year-on-year, and I'm getting to that $1.8 billion just by annualized -- or yes, annualizing the $450 million quarterly run rate we've been sort of speaking about."
