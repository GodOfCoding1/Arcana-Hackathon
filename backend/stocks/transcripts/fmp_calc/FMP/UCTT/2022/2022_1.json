    "content": " Cash from operations was negative $67.4 million compared to $43 million in the prior quarter due to lower production, increased inventory due to China shutdown and the timing of cash collections and payments. I think in Q4, we did single-digit millions, and now we're doing $30 million, $40 million a quarter out there, we'll be up to a much higher number. But I think in a rough sense, there's -- within a very short period of time, we could certainly do $700 million -- $600 million, $700 million, $800 million a quarter. So I think the Intel obviously, from announcing a new fab to holes in the ground to getting the fab up, that's a several year cycle, but we obviously want to support that valuable customer and be there for them and help them get successful on some pretty dramatic growth plans that they have. But from a revenue perspective for the next quarter, I -- we would assume that approximately $25 million would be coming out of back into that factory at least from what we had not shipped from the previous quarter. So obviously, we've been talking about having approximately $30 million to $40 million of backlog in the last couple of quarters that we would have liked to have shipped. Shanghai was shut down, couldn't shift the last two, three weeks, and that had a $40 million impact on the quarter. I believe in the past, you'd said that, that -- the first phase of that facility could do about $200 million a year or about $50 million a quarter."
