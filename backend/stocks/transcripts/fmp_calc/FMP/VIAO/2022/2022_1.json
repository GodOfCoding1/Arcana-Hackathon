    "content": " I will start by reviewing our financial and operating performance for the full year of 2021, then I will outline our first quarter 2022 results, and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. Moving to the first quarter of this year, total revenue of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac52.7 million in the first quarter 2022 increased 27.6% from 41.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 driven by growth in both the Display Solutions and Sensor Technologies segment. Revenue related to the industrial and specialized applications end market increased 24% in the first quarter 2022 and accounted also for 39% of Display Solutions revenue, compared to 41% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021. Display Solutions gross profit margin of 5.8% decreased in the first quarter of 2022 from 9.8% at the first quarter of 2021 due to sales mix and the increase in the price of certain raw materials, logistic costs, overhead, and labor cost as well as lower margins on sales orders. Research and Development expenses increased in the first quarter 2022 to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.5 million from \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to the addition of R&D capabilities, which are to a large extent related to the acquisition of Germaneers."
