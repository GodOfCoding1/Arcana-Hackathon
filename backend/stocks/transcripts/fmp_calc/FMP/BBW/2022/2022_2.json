For the first half, total revenues were $218.3 million a record setting performance for our company's first half, representing a 17% increase over the prior year. For the first half of fiscal 2022, EBITDA exceeded $32 million and subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the $25 million share repurchase authorized by our Board of Directors in November, 2021. For the first half of the year, total revenues were $218.3 million representing the highest first half in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history with growth of 17.1% compared to the fiscal 2021 first half. While mindful of the overall macro environment based on our strong first half performance and positive trends and outlook, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, which includes total revenues in the range of $440 million to $460 million as compared to $411.5 million in fiscal 2021. In closing, I am proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our team to deliver a record-setting first half of 2022 on the heels of a previous all-time high annual profitability in 2021, with a strong first half and fiscal 2022 and momentum as we enter the all important back half of the year, including the holiday season."
