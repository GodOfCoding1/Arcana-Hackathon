    "content": " First, I\u2019m pleased report that we exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectation for the quarter and delivered record net sales of $3.8 billion with organic volumes, EBITDA and free cash flow finishing in-line with our expectations, despite additional inflationary pressure and macroeconomic challenges. For the quarter, our Consumer Packaging International division delivered a 7% increase in revenue over the prior year and a 17% improvement on a two-year basis, including organic volume growth of 4%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So our volume outlook continues to be robust, I would say, in the other businesses outside of CPI, and perhaps a little bit of EM with the supply chain challenges Tom mentioned lingering here in the back half of the year. Your line is open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I have to piggyback on Mark\u2019s comments there because one thing that we should note is that over the last several years, we have continued to invest heavily in automation, and other investments to improve our efficiency and that coupled with the fact that we are fully committed to offsetting the inflation creates some tailwind opportunity for us as we see that benefit of the price recovery from a margin perspective. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
