    "quarter": 1,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-05-04 13:34:02",
    "content": " It\u2019s grounded in three pillars: First, to build on our leadership in news to be the best news destination in the world; second, to be more valuable to more people by helping them make the most of their lives and passions; and third, to provide a more expansive and connected product experience that helps people engage with everything we have to offer in a way that makes The Times indispensable to their daily lives. Total advertising revenues increased approximately 20% in the quarter with digital advertising growing more than 12%, largely as a result of our proprietary first party targeted advertising products and expanded audio product portfolio, as well as the inclusion of advertising revenue from The Athletic. Cost of revenue increased approximately 12% as a result of our acquisition of The Athletic, growth in the number of employees who work in The New York Times newsroom and on our Games, Cooking and Wirecutter products, as well as from higher subscriber servicing costs and print production and distribution costs largely as a result of higher raw material costs. I just want to point to the new kind of medium long-term guide we gave on the last call, in which we reiterated here, which is we believe the next mile marker in the model is to get to 15 million subscribers, reminding you that that\u2019s a sort of harder to achieve target than subscriptions by year end 2027."
