    "content": " Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind you that various statements the company makes during this call about future results and operations and financial positions, are -- or interpretations of data from completed and ongoing trials, business strategy and plans and objectives for the company's future operations are considered to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. As part of our pre-pivotal study planning, we completed a comprehensive market and analytics study concerning EB613 and its potential as the first oral anabolic and first oral PTH product available to postmenopausal women at high risk of osteoporosis. Second, despite endocrinologists recognizing the clinical benefit of initiating anabolic treatments such as the currently injectable PTH agents for high-risk patients prior to first-line bisphosphonates, their high cost and patient's unwillingness to opt for a subcutaneous injection is limiting treatment. And so with all of that and always with the goal of really reducing the variability that you ultimately have to deal with oral delivery, and we've seen that our optimized platform, we're achieving not only higher bioavailability but also lower variability, and we're able to address more molecules with the new IP that we've generated. So from a regulatory standpoint, there's fewer regulatory hurdles to incorporating those in new formulations that we are working on and there was also -- our scientists back at the lab were very -- did a lot of work in screening different molecules and things that could fit into our platform and we felt that the developments and the progress we made was significant, and that's why we filed the whole set of new patent applications."
