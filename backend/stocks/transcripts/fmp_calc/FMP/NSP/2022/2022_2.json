    "content": " Now, let's discuss our strong second quarter results, in which we achieved a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 27% increase in adjusted EPS on 19% growth in the average number of paid worksite employees. Our growth momentum was driven by high client retention, averaging 99% for the quarter, continued strong hiring by our clients despite the tight labor market and worksite employees paid from new client sales above our Q2 forecast. We believe the new plan implemented at the beginning of this year has the potential to achieve compound annual growth rate of 13% to 16% growth in worksite employees versus 12% in the last run, especially with such a strong start to the first year. When considering these factors, our full year guidance assumes 17% to 18% paid worksite employee growth for Q3 and slightly lower implied Q4 growth due to the comparison to the 2021 periods, when we are experiencing very strong hiring in the base as a labor market recovered from the pandemic. So I feel very comfortable that hitting our target over the balance of the year is in, clearly in view and working toward this long-term view of an 8% to 10% increase in or rate of BPA growth driving a higher worksite employee growth, we're really in good shape for that element of the plan\n Thank you."
