    "content": " As for the drivers of this growth, worksite employees paid for new client sales increased 37% over the first quarter of 2021. Our dramatic 37% increase in worksite employees paid from our successful conversion of book sales from our fall campaign into new clients and near historical high retention from our successful campaign, combined with continued strong hiring in our client base to drive nearly 20% unit growth. This expected increase is based upon our higher starting point going into Q2, continuing sales momentum, maintaining client retention at our budgeted high levels and continuing net hiring by our clients however slightly below recent trends given the potential impact of a further tightening in the labor market and inflationary pressures on the business environment. And so that, again, is part of why when I look at even this five year plan, I really see the potential grow our core business at historical double digit rates, but adding also the, I should say, above of historical double digit rates, and have the traditional employment service and sales add to our gross profit in a strong way. Yes, I think just to kind of reiterate a little bit of with Doug's comments, we -- when we looked at the going forward for the balance of the year, even though we're seeing some of the cost drivers wanes, especially related to the COVID, direct COVID related costs we felt like it was still important to stick with our cost trend that we established just a couple of months ago."
