    "content": " Now, let's discuss our strong third quarter results in which we achieved a 38% increase in adjusted EPS and a 33% increase in adjusted EBITDA over Q3 of 2021 on 18% growth in the average number of paid worksite employees. In addition to the continuing exceptional unit growth, our profitability increased more than 30% over the same period last year and adjusted EBITDA and EPS due to the combination of effective direct cost pricing and cost management and operating leverage in our business model. And if you look back at our whole history now for, I don't know how many years, we're still under 4% annual increase in our fees to clients in this area, our allocations and so that really demonstrates the effectiveness of trying to keep an eye on this for clients and keeping it as shallow as possible without a lot of volatility to it."
