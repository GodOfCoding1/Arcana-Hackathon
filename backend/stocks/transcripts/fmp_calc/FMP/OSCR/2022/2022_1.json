We are mostly saying, hey, we\u2019ve got a great product and they\u2019ll take membership, you take membership base to go after, and therefore, that\u2019s the plan and impact on the MLR of the new membership it\u2019s as Scott said, I\u2019ll echo him there between the three cohorts members who were nodes, members who came last year, and basically signed up. What I would say there is that I\u2019m expecting based on kind of just the business that we\u2019ve got now that including the broker expenses that I just talked about, we\u2019re going to see probably modestly less amounts of seasonality and specifically there, I would say that I would expect that we\u2019re going to see pretty flat levels of the admin expense ratio for most of the year with a slight notch up in Q4. Your line is open. Certainly, if we saw Medicaid redetermination, come in, in \u201822 and depending on the pacing it\u2019s so difficult to exactly predict when the healthcare emergency might end, but depending on the pacing of that, we could see that be a headwind to \u201822 would that would certainly be a tailwind at \u201823 as we would expect those members to have high retention into the following year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So really, I would expect we\u2019re going to get our first really good view in terms of the characteristics and what we should be anticipating any true ups that we need to make around our estimates for risk adjustment we\u2019ll see that in the second half right at the end of the second quarter of June, \u201822. Okay, great, thank you."
