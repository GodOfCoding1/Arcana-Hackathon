    "content": " We ended the third quarter with over 1 million members, an increase of 81% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in our individual business and our small group offering, C+O. Third quarter direct and assumed policy premiums increased 87% year-over-year to approximately $1.7 billion driven by higher membership, rate increases and business mix shifts towards higher premium silver plans. With respect to administrative costs, our third quarter \u00e2\u0080\u009822 insurance company administrative expense ratio was 20.7%, an improvement of 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by fixed cost leverage from greater scale and variable cost efficiencies, which was partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with the higher-than-expected membership. Our overall combined ratio, which is the sum of our medical loss ratio and the insurance company administrative expense ratio, was 110.6% in the quarter, a 12 point year-over-year improvement driven by the MLR and the insurance company administrative expense ratio improvements that I previously mentioned. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting that we will drive significant improvements in MLR driven by pricing for margin and total cost of care initiatives we have planned, and we have identified over $120 million in total company administrative expense cost savings based on our membership outlook."
