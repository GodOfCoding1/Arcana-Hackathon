    "content": " I would say that probably, if I look just this quarter, so fourth quarter 2022, as I think about it, perhaps somewhere in the $33 million, $33.5 million range. Say, just wanted you to see if you could give a little bit more clarity, and maybe it's Barry, but just on the fee income, just going back to that first quarter level or just how to think about some of the noise that's been running through there just with the MSR and some of the other one-timers that you guys have called out. And I would just add just some color on the loan side, I was just looking at, for example, our commercial as you think about, how things that moved in the third quarter, our weighted average yield on commercial was below \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well below 5% in July and in mid-5s by September."
