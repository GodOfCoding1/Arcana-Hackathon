    "content": " Starting with assets, core loans increased $32.8 million or 4.2% annualized from the linked quarter led by commercial loans, which increased $35 million or 5.4% annualized from the linked quarter. As Charlie noted, during the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified approximately 50% of our debt securities portfolio to held to maturity to mitigate the negative impacts to tangible book value from rising rates. Non-interest income was $11.6 million for the first quarter of 2022, which was up from a linked quarter primarily due to loan revenue. It sounds like the underlying run rate you think is closer to $30 million, but it might be elevated a little bit again in the second quarter before kind of dropping off to that level later in the year. And then one follow-on the PPP interest in fees linked quarter or just the reduction or if you have the absolute balances, that's great, but --\n I have the absolute PPP interest in fees in the first quarter $834,000 in the fourth quarter $2,128,000. I'm thinking about it really, with respect to $9 million to $9.5 million per quarter, and this is exclusive of the -- exclusive of the acquisition, Brian, I'm not kind of thinking about it on that type of run rate, is where I'm thinking about it."
