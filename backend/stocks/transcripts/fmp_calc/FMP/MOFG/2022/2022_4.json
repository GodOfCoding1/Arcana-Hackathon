    "content": " The decline was primarily due to an $800,000 decline in loan revenue due to a smaller increase in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights and a decline in our mortgage origination fee income combined with a $700,000 decrease in other income due primarily to a onetime settlement recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was partially offset by an increase of $2.5 million in the bargain purchase gain recorded in connection with the IOFB acquisition."
