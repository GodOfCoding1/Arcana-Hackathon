The fiscal fourth quarter was a strong end to a very exciting year at Algoma, that include our return to the public markets, the retirement of our senior secured debt, the start of our transformative EAF project, achievement of historically strong financial results, the commencement of a robust capital allocation program and most importantly, a continued legacy of safety for our employees.
