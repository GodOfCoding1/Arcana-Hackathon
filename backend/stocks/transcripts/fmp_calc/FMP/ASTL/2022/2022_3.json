    "content": " With that in mind, I would ask everyone on today's call to read the legal disclaimer on slide two of the accompanying earnings presentation, and to also refer to the risks and assumptions outlined in Algoma Steel's third quarter fiscal 2022 management's discussion and analysis. Before getting into the specifics of our strong results for the quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the remarkable transformation underway, how it positions Algoma in today's North American steel industry, and how it will shape our path forward. So, in conclusion, our fiscal third quarter included achieving a number of major milestones in our 120-year history, including our return to public markets, the retirement of our senior secured debt, the decision to proceed with our transformative EAF development project, achievement of historically strong financial results, and a continued legacy of safety for our employees. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So, as we go through each and every month and each and every quarter, we'll continue to evaluate what's left to spend to facilitate the electric arc implementation, see where we are in that seasonal working capital position and make sure that there is cash on hand as well that allows us to really protect ourselves through the volatility of the steel sector. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
