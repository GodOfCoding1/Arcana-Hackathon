From a cash flow perspective, cash flow from operating activity was a use of $128.6 million in the quarter compared to cash generation of $318.4 million in the prior year comparable quarter. As an update to year project spending through the end of the third fiscal quarter ended December, we have spent approximately $220 million on the EAF project and issued letters of credit of $48 million, securing fabrication and delivery of key components.
