    "content": " With that in mind I would ask everyone on today's call to read the legal disclaimers on slide 1 of the accompanying earnings presentation and to also refer to the risks and assumptions outlined in Algoma Steel's financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the full year ended March 31, 2022. The fiscal first quarter was a strong start to what promises to be a very exciting year at Algoma, one in which we will continue our relentless focus on safe, reliable, efficient operations at our existing facilities to enjoy the benefits of strong markets, even as we advance the dual EAF projects."
