    "content": " I thought that, that was an interesting example of how the Family of Apps and Metaverse visions come together, because even though most of our Reality Labs investment is going towards future computing platforms, glasses, headsets and the software to run them, as the technology develops, most people are going to experience the Metaverse for the first time on phones and then start building up their digital identities across our apps. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one thing that I would add, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit separate from your question, but we do spend most of the time talking about Reels, so maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth giving some color on the rest of the discovery engine work, which is, it has also been doing quite well and is much more incremental to the rest of the business because if people end up being able to discover additional photos or links or groups or things like that in Facebook or just interesting content across Instagram, then they are just more engaged in the product. Your line is open. Your line is open. They are both important, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also really important to focus on the first one of just making it a better company because that way, even if we outperform our business goals this year, I just want to communicate, especially the people inside the company that we are going to stick with this, because I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just going to make us a better company over the long-term. Your line is open."
