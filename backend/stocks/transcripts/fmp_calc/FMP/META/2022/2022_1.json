    "content": " I think the best experience will be on virtual and eventually augmented reality platforms and especially on our platforms like Quest, where in an upcoming release, from the moment you put on your headset you\u2019re going to be embodied with your Meta avatar and ready to interact in Horizon with your friends right from your Quest home. But if you look back, engagement for both Facebook and Instagram, remain above the levels they were at pre-pandemic and that\u2019s true both globally and in the U.S. It\u2019s true we are investing significantly in AI and machine learning investments to power ranking and recommendations for things like Ads, Reels and feed. And then I think also, Justin, you asked about sort of the second half, we would expect the growth rate in Q3 to be modestly higher than the Q2 rate since we will be lapping the first full quarter impact of ATT in Q3, but there\u2019s obviously a lot of uncertainty baked into our Q2 outlook, and that implies uncertainty in the second half as well. And as our understanding of people and our understanding of content gets better through AI, we\u2019re now better able to, across all different content types, text, links, photos, short-form videos, long-form videos, everything basically built to understand what the content is about, match it more with what people are interested in, which just means that there\u2019s a lot more candidates to show people. And the way we think about the pacing of this is that we do show ads with Reels, but we\u2019re going to show more as the content gets better and as that ramps up to not be a big kind of pain point in the user experience, where we basically match this, so that way as the ads get better across all these different formats, we\u2019re willing to show more of them."
