    "content": " The Zynlonta development program continues to make progress, encouraging safety run-in data from the Phase 3 LOTUS 5 trial in second line plus DLBCL patients was presented at the Society of Hematology Oncology Congress in September, providing initial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the Zynlonta and rituximab combination. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to grow both the community and academic segments over the coming quarters as we engage health care professionals, community networks and patients regarding Zynlonta's differentiated product profile. Although we believe our data show that Cami has a positive benefit risk profile in late-line patients, the FDA has now given strong guidance and for them to consider an accelerated approval path, a randomized confirmatory Phase 3 study must be well underway and ideally fully enrolled at the time of any BLA submission for Cami. Your line is open. Then for me, I just wanted to get a question in on Zynlonta, just mostly on the business development side of things, how looking at building into the earlier-stage pipeline that we have and then also how the developments of the early-stage pipeline that we're expecting could dictate how this development is looked at going forward next year. One moment before our next question. One moment before our next question. Your line is open. One moment before our next question. Your line is open. One moment before our next question. Your line is open."
