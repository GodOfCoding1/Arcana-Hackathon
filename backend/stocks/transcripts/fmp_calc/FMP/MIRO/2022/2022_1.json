    "content": " Today, I'll start with a brief overview of Miromatrix to remind everyone of our positioning and differentiation, followed by a business update from our first quarter before turning the call over to our CFO, Jim Douglas, for a financial review. The $6.8 million increase in net loss during the first quarter was primarily driven by the $4.5 million increase in operating loss, as well as $2.5 million of net investment gains were recorded in the first quarter of 2021 without similar gains recorded in the first quarter of 2022. Yes, I can say our clinical department is really deployed on looking at exactly that, and now talking to multiple potential sites, just to make sure that everything that we can do to bring in anything required that would extend or delay the start of a clinical trial that we're addressing that now, because we really do want the shortest process from the time of the clearance, the time of initiating our first human clinical studies. So if we back that out, our quarter spend excluding one-time facility cost was about $6.4 million that's plus or minus $2 million per month, which is a pretty good barometer as to what we think the remainder of \u201822 and \u201823 will look like."
