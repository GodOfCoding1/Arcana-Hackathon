    "content": " The $4.4 million increase in net loss during the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the increase in total operating expenses, as well as net investment gains that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, without similar gains recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The $4.4 million increase in net loss for the full year was driven by the increase in total operating expenses and partially offset by a $2.4 million equity loss and affiliate recorded in 2020, which was significantly larger than the amount recorded in 2021."
