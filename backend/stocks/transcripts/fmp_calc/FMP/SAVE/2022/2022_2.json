    "content": " Before discussing our second quarter results, on July 28, we entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which JetBlue will acquire Spirit for $33.50 per share in cash, including a prepayment of $2.50 per share in cash upon Spirit's stockholders' approval of the transaction and a ticking fee of $0.10 per month starting in January 2023 up to a maximum amount of $34.15 per share. Given these inputs, we estimate our third quarter revenue will range between $1.33 billion to $1.37 billion with TRASM up 18% to 21% versus third quarter 2019, and we expect to achieve these results on approximately 14% more capacity than we produced in third quarter 2019 while also growing stage by around 1.5%. And what I mean about how it's acting normal is we're still seeing and we expect to see unit revenue improvements in every month here in the quarter and moving into the fall, and it's staying at relatively consistent unit revenue growth numbers in each month."
