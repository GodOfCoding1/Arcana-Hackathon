    "content": " With that, I will hand it over to Matt and Scott to share additional details about our fourth quarter performance as well as some color around our first quarter outlook before I close with some thoughts on full year 2023. Turning now to our fourth quarter revenue performance, total revenue was $1.39 billion, up 43.5% compared to the fourth quarter 2019, the largest top line growth of the major U.S. carriers that have reported results thus far. Fuel costs were up more than 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on about 20% more volume due to a 69% increase in the average fuel price per gallon, fuel prices have remained stubbornly high driven in large part by historically high refining margins, but the current curve does suggest jet fuel prices will move lower as we progress through the year. We estimate the new rates and benefits drive an additional $180 million of wages, salaries and benefits expense for the full year of 2023 or about $40 million to $45 million a quarter with an additional onetime expense in the first quarter of about $10 million related to the revaluation of bank sick and vacation time. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We do make an assumption that we are going to be collectively with Pratt resolving the availability issue on the neo throughout the remainder of this year, such that by the time we hit the fourth quarter, we are able to support full utilization, which would include aircraft that are currently unable to be operated. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
