    "content": " Given the breadth of our solutions, our technical innovation, our operational capabilities, the favorable market trends, and ultimately, the strong demand from customers, we look forward to another record-setting year in fiscal 2023, where we expect to achieve at least $200 million in revenue, which would represent growth of more than 88%. Now, turning to guidance for the first quarter, we currently expect revenue in Q1 fiscal 2023 to be between $43.5 million and $47.5 million, up 21% sequentially at the midpoint and 324% year-over-year. Your line is open. Well, as far as the second hyperscalar that we're working with, we expect the ramp to begin in fiscal 2023 and so with that said, it's sometimes hard to pinpoint exactly when the ramp is going to happen because there's tremendous complexities around the exact deployment schedule of our end customers. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
