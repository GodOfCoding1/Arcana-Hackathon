    "content": " Consistent with our 2023 financial guidance, we expect to see an immediate acceleration of top and bottom line growth in 2023 propelled by lower Xtampza ER gross to net prescription growth of BELBUCA and Xtampza ER on a full year basis and the full year impact of the synergized cost structure. And by leveraging our fully synergized cost structure, we expect Xtampza ER revenue to immediately accelerate as a result of gross to net improvement, and on a full year basis we expect BELBUCA and Xtampza ER prescription growth. As previously disclosed during 2022, we achieved a complete resolution of our returns matter reflecting a positive $4.7 million adjustment associated with the resolution while the fourth quarter and full year 2021 reflect a negative $38.3 million adjustments related to the returns matter. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Xtampza ER net revenue was $35.2 million and Xtampza ER gross to net was 69.1%. For 2022, Xtampza ER net revenue was $138.8 million and gross to net was 69.3%. We are committed to rapidly deleveraging our balance sheet we're on track to repay $162.5 million of debt in 2023, which would put us at less than 1.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at year-end. In addition and relative to Xtampza ER, following the successful completion of the first wave of contract renegotiations to drive gross to net below 65% we're looking to opportunistically secure new payer wins, which can serve as a catalyst for prescription growth, while ensuring gross to net below 65% going forward."
