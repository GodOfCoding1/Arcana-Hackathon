    "content": " Over the past few years, we have continued to invest heavily in digital that allow us to, for example, during the pandemic, have direct outreach to our consumer, roll out new products, new marketing campaigns efficiently and also allow us to -- if you look at our membership program, which continue to be a very strong foundation for ourselves, the membership program now accounts for north of 60% of our sales. So maybe look at it, all the initiatives in the third quarter and also during the pandemic in these 3 years, you've been focusing on really kind of rejuvenizing the menu and the new product launch and smaller stores, a very effective promotional campaign. So I think -- and then also, if you look at -- in terms of rental, for a new store, obviously, we have worked very hard to lower the rental cost . So I think our approach to new store opening is very disciplined and systematic, as I mentioned before, and we'll continue to drive that discipline so that when we open new stores, as we continue to at a very robust pace and likely accelerate during the fourth quarter, we will continue to open not only new store but profitable store. And also, as I mentioned before, I mean each year, we set a target we think what is reasonable, but ultimately, it is for the market and the fundamentals that we would try how many stores that will be opened and then also sometimes get impacted by COVID. I think we don't -- I don't think we can say like we're there yet, but building a new brand, a new business is going to take time, but they have done a great job in terms of putting the right -- organizing the right team, putting the -- continue to innovate in the product."
