    "content": " The theme here of the aggressive new store openings is resiliency because while we emphasize how many stores we have opened in the last three years, how many -- 3,700 net new store, but actually 4,800 growth new -- growth store. Thank you, Joey and Andy. So going forward, we will focus even more on driving sales, and then continue the disciplined approach, which includes accelerating store growth, Andy talked about targeting 1,100 to 1,300 net new stores in 2023. But let's not forget, in the last three years, the smaller brands actually had more challenging time to test, to try their store format, their sales, the different system piece of store models, and we are certainly looking forward to the -- a bit more supportive environment for the smaller brands to grow. First now, regarding the company's exposure, that 5% same-store sales growth -- sorry, mid-single-digit same-store sales growth during Chinese New Year. For the Chinese New Year same-store sales, the mid-single-digit number, KFC did better, slightly better than Pizza Hut, because of the transportation hub stores performed very well. Thank you, Joey and Andy. And I'm just wondering, if you guys think your new target is a bit too conservative, because, obviously, you guys have done really well last year on opening more than 1,100 stores last year with COVID. In terms of by brand, I think like, obviously, KFC remain the largest brand for small opening and you've seen Pizza Hut have accelerated to opening, as Joey mentioned, a record number in probably recent years with a number of years, even before pandemic."
