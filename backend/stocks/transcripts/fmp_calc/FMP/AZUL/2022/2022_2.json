    "content": " It's been corporate and leisure and so I'll give an example, our vacations business, Azul Viagens actually had higher bookings in July than it did in June, even though July is the month that you actually travel, which is a really good indication that the leisure market is strong and it's already looking ahead the second half of the year and the summer season. And so I think that we don't see anybody doing crazy things going after market share, because it's not in their best interest to do it, because they would plead significantly because they don't have the right aircraft type, kind of given the hostile fuel environment where we are today. I think we are encouraged by the fact that even though we consider ourselves an efficient airline, wherever you look, there is opportunity, you can manage processes battery, you can invest in technology, there is just a lot of stuff that we're going to continue pursuing essentially forever, right, to keep our cost as low as possible, because that is necessary for us to continue expanding margins."
