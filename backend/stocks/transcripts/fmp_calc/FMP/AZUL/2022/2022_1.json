    "content": " As you can see on Slide 6, even with these exceptional challenges, we reported an all -time first quarter record revenue of BRL3.2 billion, an increase of 75% compared to first quarter 2021 and almost 26% up compared to the same period in 2019. On the cost side, as you can see on Slide 13, CASK in the quarter was $0.34, up 30% compared to first quarter 2019, mainly due to a 75% increase in fuel prices and as 39% depreciation of the real against the dollar, and three years of inflation on real denominated costs. And also you have -- when we compare to 2019, you're talking about three years of inflation plus our cargo business which has grown a lot obviously generates a lot of cash contribution, it's much more profitable then the group -- the average margin for the group, but it does help RASK and hurt CASK right."
