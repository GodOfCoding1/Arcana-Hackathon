    "content": " Moving forward, as you can see on Slide 6, we delivered another all-time record revenue of BRL4.4 billion in the quarter, up 44% versus the same period in 2019, while generating 6.5% more capacity and had a load factor of 82% in the quarter. Our network advantages combined with strong demand for our services allowed us to raise fares by 43%, while stage length remained flat to 2019, a clear sign that we're allocating the capacity in the right markets at the right time. In addition to making financial sense, it's also clearly a more sustainable way to grow with our fuel consumption per risk, ASK, down 8% compared to third quarter 2019, and carbon emissions down an incredible 30% since 2016. And so we don't have a bad guy in terms of cost of capital, in terms of the cost for the aircraft that's coming in, which is actually a great reminder because we do have competitors who are a lot behind us in the fleet transformation process, as John mentioned. So it's very technical, but we're essentially the gain that there is that happened as a onetime gain today this quarter on our results is the comparison between the cash that we're getting on the sale of the aircraft versus what was provisioned."
