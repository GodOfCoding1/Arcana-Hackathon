    "content": " In Q3, we eclipsed 1,000 large customers and now have 1,113 customers with more than a 100,000 of ARR, a record quarterly increase of 124 and a record annual increase of 398, representing 56% year-over-year growth. As a result, 55% of Q3 net new ACV came from existing customers and our dollar-based net retention rate for core customers and large customers remained above our targets of 115% and 125%, respectively. And we're seeing really good balance right now as we mentioned, 55% of our net new ACV in Q3 were tied to expansions to existing customers. And so, more and more of our business is coming from 100,000 plus customers, 47% of our overall ARR is driven from that that customer cohort now, and you can see how that's increased over the last, you know, couple of years. We do recognize that there's a lot of macro uncertainty, and so we want to make sure that we are given a little bit of color into next year, based on how we're thinking about things, as well as going through some different scenario analysis and we feel good with where the, kind of consensus FY 2024 revenue growth rates are right now in the high 20s percent that, you know, we forget about that, you know, based on what we're seeing right now. You know, I'd point you to just the overall ARR mix coming from 100,000 plus customers continues to move up, but it's moving up, kind of like a percentage point every quarter, which means that the customers being below a 100,000 are also growing really, really quickly and driving a lot of our overall growth."
