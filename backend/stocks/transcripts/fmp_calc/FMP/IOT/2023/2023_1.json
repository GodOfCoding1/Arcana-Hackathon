    "content": "  More than 75% of our adjusted free cash flow in Q1 was related to payments for IoT devices and while these purchases result in negative net working capital today, while we\u2019re growing rapidly, we anticipate net working capital will turn positive in our long-term model, primarily from a more stable global supply chain, improved device optimizations and a larger renewal base that won\u2019t require new devices, all of which will lead to operating margin and free cash flow margin converging over time."
