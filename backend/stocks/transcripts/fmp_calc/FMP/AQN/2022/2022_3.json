    "content": " The company recorded increased tax expense year-over-year of $15 million driven by lower year-over-year recognition of tax credits, which was mainly a result of revised estimates associated with renewable projects that are now expected to be placed in service in 2023, including New Market Solar. As a result of factors such as higher interest rates, the push-out to 2023 of the New Market Solar project and the recent order from the California Commission revising the CalPeco rate case decision to 2023, we are now seeing pressure on 2022 adjusted net earnings per share. And then when we reflect on next year, I think consistent really with the internal plan we expect the renewables business to be somewhat flat based on its lumpiness of the development, and then we have that continued pressure from the increased interest rates, I'd say is the main driver for next year."
