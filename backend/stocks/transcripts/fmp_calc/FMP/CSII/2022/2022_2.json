    "content": " In Q2, we trained 61 new physicians, and 52 new peripheral accounts adding to our future pipeline of OAS users in the U.S. We are going to launch into approximately 25% of our U.S. PAD income and expect this to ramp considerably in the next 2 quarters, given the significant number of large contracts secured and effective January 1. In Q2, we began training over 200 fellows, certified 101 new users and opened 11 new coronary accounts in the U.S. We look forward to working with these physicians to complete their certification in the months ahead and are excited by the enthusiasm we are seeing in the expanded utilization of our products. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Having said that, I think we also are seeing that physicians recognize and understand in their own practice that one they come across severely calcified lesions where they have a high degree of stenosis or a nodular lesions where there's a lot of intimate calcium but these are cases where they really do need to use atherectomy and we're seeing them come back to that in their more standard daily clinical practice, which is what we expected. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
