    "content": " Although COVID remains the most important factor that is negatively impacting our business, we are also responding to an increasingly competitive environment with new products and new players entering our markets and following the recent issuance of the physician fee schedule, we are anticipating increased economic pressure for our customers who perform PVI procedures in the office-based labs setting. But I think it's a little bit inappropriate to really be considering market share right now, because until we see the IVL in the marketplace begin to annualize, it probably is not that relevant to look at market share. And that is where I think we begin to think about how the IVL balloons are really broadening and expanding vessel preparation, because IVL balloons can be used by a larger population of physicians and is used in a broader population of patients, let's say, than just atherectomy. So in the coronary segment, I think we are seeing an environment that is much more defined by the appropriate indications for use for each of these technologies and economics plays a larger or let's say a smaller role."
