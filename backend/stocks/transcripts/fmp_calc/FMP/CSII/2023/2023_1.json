    "content": " The launch of the Scoreflex scoring balloon is going really well, generating over $1.7 million in sales during Q1, which helped drive an increase in coronary ISD revenue of 70% to $4.5 million. Coronary support product revenue increased 70% to $4.5 million, led by continued adoption of the Sapphire 1-millimeter angioplasty balloons and the recent launch of Scoreflex NC. Outside the U.S., quarterly revenue increased 41% to $4.5 million as a result of continued strength in Japan and Europe. We believe the continued market recovery, combined with improving commercial execution, competitive momentum, new product introductions, and international expansion will drive our revenue to a range of $255 million to $265 million, representing 8% to 12% annual growth. With improved commercial execution, competitive momentum and the launch of the 2.0 Max Crown, we are confident that we can deliver mid-single-digit flex and the continued momentum in the sale of JADE balloons is driving 66% growth in our support product revenue and our international business delivered 40% growth in Q1."
