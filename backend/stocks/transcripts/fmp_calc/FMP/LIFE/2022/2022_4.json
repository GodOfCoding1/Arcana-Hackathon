    "content": " 2022 was an important year for aTyr as we advanced efzofitimod to a global pivotal Phase 3 study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the most prevalent form of ILD that affects nearly 200,000 people in the U.S. and more than 1.2 million worldwide. We announced last month that we are expanding the clinical development program for efzofitimod to include a Phase 2 study in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis, which is known as SSC or more commonly scleroderma. We see SSc-ILD as a logical second indication to explore for efzofitimod, based on the clinical proof-of-concept demonstrated in pulmonary sarcoidosis patients and the translational effects seen in an animal model of SSs, where efzofitimod was shown to reduce lung and skin fibrosis. Our results of operations included research and development expenses of $42.8 million for the year ended 2022, which consisted of clinical development costs for the Phase 3 EFZO-FIT study, manufacturing costs for the efzofitimod and ATYR2810 programs and research and development costs for the efzofitimod and discovery programs. This takes into account the allocation of resources to programs that are driving the most meaningful value for the company, namely the clinical development program for efzofitimod and maintaining an active discovery program with our tRNA synthetase pipeline candidates, where we continue to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we intend to continue to identify targets for some of our tRNA synthetase fragments, but not proceed with more costly late-stage preclinical activities."
