    "content": " The event will bring together sarcoidosis medical experts, principal investigators, advocacy organizations, analysts, investors, and members from aTyr's management team, providing an opportunity to learn more about our Efzofitimod clinical program, and the ways in which we can all work together to deliver a potential new treatment to patients in need. While our primary focus for Efzofitimod is on our planned registrational study in pulmonary sarcoidosis, Efzofitimod mechanism of action, compelling translational and clinical data and the shared immune pathology in ILD, strongly suggest that Efzofitimod could have potential to treat other ILD indications as well. Scleroderma is a chronic progressive autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of connective tissues throughout the body, where then half of all patients with underlying scleroderma may develop ILD, which is a primary cause of death in these patients, like sarcoidosis, SSC, ILD results from an uncontrolled persistent immune response, which if left untreated can result in scarring that permanently causes loss of lung function. The tentative was recently approved for slowing the rate of lung function decline in scleroderma ILD patients, but did not display any effects on the underlying disease or patient quality of life in those clinical trials, we believe our differentiated mechanism of action targeting NRP2 on immune cells has the potential to translate into benefit not only on lung function, but on the underlying disease as well."
