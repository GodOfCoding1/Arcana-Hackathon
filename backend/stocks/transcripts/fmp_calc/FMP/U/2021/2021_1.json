    "content": "  Operator: \u2026Abrupt start .... so with me on the call today is John Riccitiello, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Chairman; and Luis Visoso, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. So as we did last quarter, we will open up with introductory remark by John and Luis. And finally, time permitting; we'll have the last 10 minutes or so for panelists to ask additional questions. And while society has and likely always will face many challenges, it's reassuring, at least in a large part of the world, to see some light at the end of the tunnel with regard to the COVID pandemic. At Unity, we remain focused on our North Star our guiding principle, which is that we believe the world is a better place with more creators. Our focus, as always, is to enable these creators and to help them succeed. In Q1, we grew revenue 41% year-over-year to $235 million. We support our customers on many platforms and in numerous geographies, and today are the only high scale solution for creating an operating real-time3D globally. Now we recognize that we are in a privileged position relative to under other content creation tools, content built with Unity gives end users agency of what they see, the distinctive characteristic is a fundamentally different, more engaging, and we believe, better way to interact with content. One of our key competitive advantages is we've built Unity platform to be relevant for a developer throughout their career from high school hobbyist to their first job, and beyond. Q1 '21 revenue of $235 million grew 41% year-over-year, with strong performance across the board. Pre revenue of $70 million was 51% year-over-year, operating revenue of $147 million was up 40% year-over-year, and strategic partnership revenue of $18 million was up 12% year-over-year. We had 837 customers each generate more than $100,000 of revenue in the trailing 12 months as of March 31, 2021, up from 668 a year earlier. And our dollar based net expansion rate as of March 31, 2021 was 140%, up from 133% a year earlier as customers expand their business with Unity. Unity enables creators to develop and operate real-time 3D content, providing them the right infrastructure and tools to create and monetize their work. A good illustration this quarter is in our simulations product, which we show under create where we added customers in household appliances, Home Improvement, healthcare, aerospace and government. Q1 '21 non-GAAP operating loss was $23.4 million compared to $13.4 million last year, as we increase our investments in R&D and vertical expansion that we expect will enable future growth. We expect to breakeven on a non-GAAP operating income basis, we think fiscal year 2023 and expect gross margins to fluctuate in this high 70%. Q1 2021 free cash flow margin of minus 43% was particularly impacted by the payment of our fiscal year 2020 bonus, higher payroll taxes mostly related to employee stock vesting, prepayments for software licenses, and increasing working capital as our business grows and a one time payment related to our real estate. We have 4,389 employees at the end of the quarter, up 50% from last year's March quarter. Great, thanks very much. So okay, we're going move into the Q&A section of the call. And so what we've done, as I've said, is we've collected all the questions and sorted them out in a kind of a logical fashion. So instead of using 20 year old methodologies, we're actually going into the late 2020, mid-2020s. In any case, let's start with this. So let's begin with our newest member of the Unity team, Louise, who joined as last month. We actually prioritize investments in R&D, as we continue to strengthen capabilities to capture the very significant opportunity in front of us resulting from this 2D to real-time 3D transition that both John and I've been talking about. But overall, our investment behind, we invest behind ideas that have the potential to build large solutions with attractive financials; we're always looking at the long term. As a result, we strive to do both enhance our existing portfolio and invest in new products in gaming and verticals. Thanks for the question, Gal. And I think of this vector SaaS and not as, or, keep in mind that many of the capabilities that we -- that are required to win in games also enable us to win in other verticals. This means that while the customer use cases are very different, we have already built out that platform that is the foundation for real-time 3D content creation or application built. So we believe when you combine the head start that are platform gives us with a leading market share in several segments, you get this virtuous cycle that helps us build our growth across gaming and verticals. And the intense result is that we are able to cost effectively meet our customers, wherever they are in their journey from basic workflows to full blown applications. So Chris Merwin, at Goldman Sachs asked, on our February call, you suggested that IDFA would begin in the spring that would be about a $30 million headwind to your revenue growth this year, iOS14.5 came out April 26. But now that I'm on the other side, I even more impressed and see the plans in detail. Our operating organization captures and analyzes 15 billion in app events each day; you do the math, that's about 35 million in app events every minute. Great, thanks very much. And it's kind of an addition to what Luis just said, but basically, look, there's no question that IDFA is a challenge for a lot of creators and while Luis, outlined a lot of the levers, and ways that we can help our customers navigate, we were not under estimating the challenges that our customers and others in the ecosystem, including some competitors are facing. So in the short run, there's no question that it'll be a challenge for some of our customers. But in the long run, we believe the more innovative and nimble studios will come out ahead. And in that case, that's a good thing for the industry, because it'll make it stronger and more durable. All right, let's, let's rotate over to a macro question. So it's clear you're speaking about end users, Chris. And what I would say is there's no question 2020 was a watershed year, consumers are enjoying gaming at levels that I might well have expected by the year 2025. Now, earlier, Luis mentioned, all those data points we have to address. We understand engagement, LTV; cost to acquire, literally in every country in the world, minute to minute, our data understanding is huge. And everything I see makes me feel like a big part of the left is permanent, people have changed their behaviors, they've changed the way they game, they've changed the way they look at gaming people have come into the industry. Normally, we would see a sharp left, as we go from say, October-November through to the next half giving holiday and in the Christmas holiday, kids going home from school, and that pattern will start to see that but we're indexing a year ago to a period where they were already at home for the entire quarter, point that I'm making is, I do think that not only was COVID, and the work from home aspects of this, really unprecedented and driving engagement. Point number one, if it's permanent. In some of the year-over-year, look backs are going to be interesting, because they won't be the normal, comparative seasonality that we would otherwise expect. We have a question from Bhavan Suri at William Blair, about data. So as we kind of get these network effects up and running, how are we thinking about the opportunity to introduce even a marketplace for consumer's kind of drive recommendations based on friends that are playing, et cetera. Well, thanks for that question. First off, we're proud to say that over a third of the world's population is on our platform. And it really helps us understand our marketplace, and allows us to leverage network effects with game developers, right, better and more relevant marketing, contextual messaging, and the rest of it sort of supports the monetization. So we understand the cost to acquire; we understand the LTV of our customers, we understand the interplay, and a level of nuance, it really helps us do a better job for our customers. So it is a network effect, we count our MAUs to 3 billion, even our largest customers are rarely at a great month 10% of that. Now to amplify on some of the data that Luis highlighted, we had 50 billion app events on over 20 platforms. Now let's switch over to another part of operate, so operate beyond monetization. So Tom Roderick at Stifel asks so while monetization is a very good business, you also have several other operations or offerings under the operating umbrella. Sure, I'm particularly excited about multiply, we plan to grow this faster than we'll operate, becoming a larger portion of the operate revenue mix. I believe it's a multi million more, let me say again, in time a multi billion dollar opportunity. It's cloud orchestration for real-time 3D, we put this business, I put this business under Ingrid and her team, who continues to do a great job running and operate. They're making it easier to self position, the streamline the pricing models, there's a concerted sales effort looks like it's paying off several large deals in the pipeline. And seeing the trend to move consumer is really resonating with multiplayer games, social displaying huge, they want you to get more success. And it's been used by some of the world's best known games, new features and functionality are coming and going live in the second half of the year. And then we've got our cloud Delivery Network, it's, I think we're really on the right side of history here. A lot coming, I really feel confident that more user generated content, more content updates is going to drive increasing uptake there. Let's go over to create for game so Franco Granda at DA Davidson asks, as large triple A video game developers renew their focus on mobile gaming. Number two how has Unity engaged with them, as they look to maximize not only the efficiencies of game development process, but also the monetization aspect. So the first point is we have seen more engagement from AAA studios, both for AAA games, and for the mobile games that they're building on the AAA intellectual property. But find it's time consuming, costly, and often a bit of a challenge, if not disastrously error prone. For example, when highly successful AAA franchise like Call of Duty come to Unity to use our development platform to build for mobile, they're getting there faster, quicker, better. And if you look at the charts, you'll see many of the world's largest, most successful mobile games are built on Unity. Secondly, we began to see some games start in mobile or in AA and then moved to AAA. And sometimes we have side launched successful game on Nintendo Switch and move that title to other platforms, whether that is a mobile or console title. And finally, with the rise of cross platform play, we've seen PC games cross over to consoles and vice versa. The value of using Unity's platform becomes even more obvious in these circumstances, cross play multi platform; right once published all platforms that are our bread and butter. And we keep up to speed on these platforms minute to minute, or day to day maybe it's not minute to minute. Your addressable market, Tam, addressable market for game artists as multiples of that of the programmer opportunity due to the shifting trends involving more artists at Game Studios. Bhavan, thanks for that question. And a scenario we've made the most progress and realistically, also still have a lot of progress in front of us. Investments we've made in visual scripting, new rendering pipelines, and over a workflows are brought many artists under the Unity platform. And the early work done with AI augmentation for artistry, including what we provide with Art engine, also is bringing artists on the platform and for those of you who don't know exactly what I'm talking about. Now, if you want more contexts on this, you might want to look at a case study. It's on our website, one of our AAA studios. Insomniac, you'll see him there. But here's the thesis. And everyday we seek to serve them better, more tools, better tools. Okay, let's pivot over to kind of create for verticals. So look, I guess I can say that the construction market recovery has been a tailwind. And it likely will be for some time but realistically, we're relatively nascent in these industries with more customers. For example, we continue to work closely with innovators like Sweden based Skanska, the fifth largest construction company in the world, we recently signed JE Dunn for site license for visual live, JE Dunn is a $5 billion top 25 construction company. The point here is that we've begun to see the who's who would prospective customers in architecture, engineering construction. He asks there's been a handful of new product releases in the last quarter tied to enabling AI, machine learning, robotic applications in manufacturing and industrial markets, via models, computer vision simulation, synthetic data, could you frame the broader opportunity in manufacturing and industrial market for these tools and others gone? So I'm going to slightly reform -- reframe your question, but it could be held specifically to manufacturing and the industrial market. The key thesis is as we move from industry to industry, their needs are incredibly similar. One thing about it, one way to think about it, computer vision use cases content for simulation and extreme scale for the training of AI models streaming with the particulars right for real-time 3D, say versus linear, which is quite different. These are capabilities near inherent to Unity, were fairly easy to address, and they open massive opportunities in gaming and in many other industries. Like our tools for large team collaboration for version control for large amount of data that go with real-time 3D, that have us believe we are truly unbounded opportunity that at Unity we just the last few years has expanded our market presence and product portfolio pretty substantially. Today, many well known brands use Unity technology and AEC automotive, manufacturing, media and entertainment. And as you saw in our press release, we announced new customers in health care, government, retail, and look to bring real-time 3D to their customers and employees. Today, our portfolio encompasses our core Unity editor, but also forma for easy production of 3D content, reflect for AR/VR for BIM models, periods for streaming in real-time 3D experiences, HDMI for heads up displays bars for XR creation. But here's the thesis. Okay, we'll make this a trifecta. And I can take this, it's basically in addition to what John just said, look, up to this point, we've been seeding the market, mostly through our sales, but also working closely with our verified service providers. However, as John just referenced, we have a strong and kind of growing foundation in gaming that makes sense for us beyond gaming, it makes sense for us to kind of partner with a handful of global professional services firms. We don't have anything to say now but hopefully if we keep working hard on that, we'll do well in that regard. And then last but not least, Gal Munda of Berenberg gets the most interesting question award this quarter. With NVIDIA becoming, quote a new software company. And of course NVIDIA isn't the only company talking metaverse, EPIC, Roadblocks even big platforms like Apple and Google, Facebook and Microsoft has suggested that they too are metaverse. John, this is one of your favorite topics. It's become a favorite topic for me, because I think that we have a problem with terminology where I'm not sure we're all talking about the same thing. Let me start by saying that I think of Jensen as a friend, and I don't see NVIDIA as a competitor. They're a great company, and we collaborate with them on a lot of things. And I want to be clear in spelling this out I'd argue that say for example, if I go online to buy a shirt like this, and the seller shows me a picture of a of a black or dark green button down. I'm not really in the metaverse, but when I see a model in a scene, walking and turning in my direction, that model is me wearing this shirt. You've heard this from me before, 2D became 3D. My solo experience became social internet or an interactive in a phrase, it became real-time 3D. There'll be millions of endpoints in the metaverse and these will include shopping sites, games, social networks, messaging apps, 3D conferencing, and job sites and constructions augmented by real-time 3D in the form of Unity reflect. Now, before I get into that, let me make this point even a little bit more clear. So back to the point I made about the metaverse today, just today, I played a few games made three online purchases with two online shopping sites. I jointly edited document online, I visited an OMB website, and you get some data for presentation and making. The metaverse is, in other words, the more engaging, more interactive, more 3D, more real-time version of the internet. So how will this metaverse come into existence in huge scale, as I predict, I see four major enablers. These are the fiber optic lines of faster GPUs and stuff that Jensen and NVIDIA and provision of 5G, the satellite GPS systems getting better and stronger. Second are the underlying operating services enable real-time 3D hosting like multiplayer streaming, computer vision, monetization services. Third, there are the content creation tools, the real-time 3D tools. And lastly, there are those millions of endpoints. And these will include all the examples I've mentioned, and more. So today, Unity has the substantial majority of all the real-time 3D content created in gaming and an industry, we are the tool of choice for these endpoints. Unity is a substantial player, also an operate services. And as you know, we don't provide hardware and we don't make games. But if the metaverse has music, it's really playing our song. And so with this, we don't see in videos competition, we view them as a partner, and co conspirator where we could not -- we couldn't do it without them. We're in it together, building the future with the metaverse. EPIC, Fortnite, roadblocks, Microsoft, Minecraft are endpoints or destinations in the metaverse and we'd love to see them grow, proving the point. And if I were to reference the most recent presentations of the metaverse, the Oasis and Ready Player 1, a movie that use Unity and part of its production, I'd see these important rides in the theme park that will take us and make up the entirety of the metaverse. Well, now we have open mic, it's like, open mic Friday, or whatever. But if you all have questions that you want to ask live, feel free to pop your hand up or whatever. So Otherwise, I'll just call on you. So if we have any questions, just hit the raise hand button. Hey, I just wanted to know, I had two questions you could address either one of them. So, yes, those are my questions. Luis, why don't you take the first one, I'll take, the second. I think in terms of the growth that we expect, I think John referred to a little bit about it, I think multi-play a scenario where we see significant opportunity for growth. But, frankly, I'm optimistic across the board. Now, as I said, in my prepared remarks, we've seen very strong growth across the company. And there is no reason why that's going to change in my view, after being here for a month, but I'm optimistic across the board, actually. So, in terms of making games, it's come up a lot of times in the past, and the answer is no. Like, I don't think competing with your customers is the easiest way to win conversion. And honestly, I think it's one of the reasons why, particularly in mobile, where I think we have advantages over other engines that have competitive products out there. It's one of the reasons we've grown from, I don't know, low double digits low teens five years ago in market share and wasn't measurable back then it's our best estimate to 71% on the Christmas quarter this last year, we've been steadily increasing market share across the board. I think one of the reasons is our customers trust us inside their building with their deepest secrets, not worried that we're going to pop up and compete with them. All right, I see a couple hands up. Great, thanks for taking the question. You guys be by roughly $20 million in the first quarter in terms of revenue, and raise the full year by close to $50 million. Yes, I think overall, we're feeling good about the business. Very strong Q1, very strong business across -- it's broad base, as I just mentioned, and our projections for the year look very healthy. So that's where we are Mario, we are -- we're very encouraged with the health of the business particularly given the environment we're in. So I think last week, we were able to see the financials of one of your competitors in the 3D game engine space. So just wondering at a high level, what percentage you think would be fair economics offering game engine over time. So I believe that it's pretty obvious that if we do a billion dollars this year, and you've got an industry approaching a couple 100 billion dollars, our take rate is under 1% in gaming, pretty straightforward. But as we expand the number of services and capabilities, some of which we charge for incrementally as we do in verticals and some in gaming as well, we can increase our take rate, led by the simple thesis that we add more value first. So it's not leveraging some sort of advantage on our customers to raise prices, although it's possible to raise prices, I think we're going to expand our take rate in a growing industry as we have and will continue to do as a consequence of adding more services more capability. If we can help make artists 10 times more productive, there's no reason developers won't pay for that one of two ways. Artists coming to the platform, which ended up itself, increase their take rate. And there are premium products and services we can provide around data training data, data and AI, which we also charge for. And so we have the ability to increase her take rate in proportion to the way that we add value, and we're increasing that value that we add across industries, but particularly in gaming every day. Hey, I'm even giving a video here. We like in, hey, John, can you I know, this is a small deal. Would love your thoughts on other players out there that directly own, operate, build game title as opposed to having development platform, what you see as a response from the game developers, maybe it's a response to IDFA. But how you feel about that, and new emerging competitive marketing or digital advertising marketplaces. So first off, I have to say, Frank is one of my favorite people on the world, you can quote me on that. So anything that he does, was saying I'm sure he's got -- he's been thoughtful and smart. We're -- we've got a beat on $3 billion users, we're increasing our ability to understand that user base, dramatically every quarter, that leads to competitive advantage for our customers, they come to us with their supply and or to drive their demand in order to make their brand yield more installs. There was a time four or five years ago, where we were smaller than Chart Boost. Or four years ago, even there was a time not that long ago, where we couldn't possibly imagine competing with the major mega cap players in our space. And we've made up a lot of ground and gained a lot of market share, driven by competitive advantage in the way we do it. So we're never really worried about competition more amusing things I find is when I talk to journalists, they keep waiting for me to say something nasty about Tim, over at EPIC, I like Tim. I am sure that our business is bigger, because of the innovation they've done to bring us to our best competitive spirit and execution. And so I like 41% quarters, and I'd like to string a lot of them together for you. And I was answering the last question I said, we increase our take right, by increasing the value we add. Short term, we can always maybe eke out a few dollars by messing around with pricing or messing around with other things that are hard to lap. So now you've had about a month to settle in, I guess, what are your first takeaways of the -- not only to the finance platform but Unity in general. I think in terms of surprise is people are so passionate about winning here, nothing is impossible. You have a problem and everybody's smiling, which is not happening in every other company I've been part of. The other thing that's very unique and you see it when you're sitting at the board, but you can really see when you're part of the company is the culture. It's a company where you can agree and disagree, and everybody expects that expects you to be honest. And to John's point earlier, we want to do -- we want growth to come from new customers, and expanding business with existing customers, right, and if we can get all those flywheels moving in the right direction, I think the possibilities are really limitless. So you've got over $1.6 billion in cash, how should we think about capital deployments over the next year or two? I mean, as you know, we've always been acquiring a few companies here and there as we continue to find technologies that will accelerate our growth and which we can get at a reasonable price. If you have time for one more, John. And John, maybe weighing that as well, you are aggressively investing in R&D. Share with us, where are you putting those dollars to work. So on King, first, I'll say a tad of an insider story, whether CTO join us on our most 2 ago, global town halls. And it's interesting, if you look at King; first off, they're one of the most innovative creative organizations on the planet. And so when we get a quote from or get support from King, it makes us proud, they didn't get there by accident. Beside from being one of the most successful developers in the world in mobile, it was probably six could have been seven years ago. But in that timeframe, I think it was six, they announced that they were taking their mobile game engine and making it free to the universe of developers around the world, in direct competition with Unity, it's time they didn't use Unity at all. I have to say, that was a bad day for me, I didn't particularly like the idea we're trying to win their business and not lose it. In the time that passed, they obviously gave a deep scrutiny. And from there, more and more, they started using our products and services. And today, we have a deeply respectful relationship and a powerful one that we feel really good about. And if you look at how much we're investing relative to our growth, obviously, we're generating leverage in sales and marketing. We're generating significant leverage in G&A, but we are investing in R&D and that's particularly to drive more of as you know we were expanding from games and now including more and more verticals. And although there is a lot of synergy, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some areas where we do need to continue to invest. As I look forward, I will continue, I think we will continue to invest most of the incremental dollars in R&D. Yes, one thing just add on that question, because I think as an outsider, looking at any organization that invests in R&D, it always seems kind of opaque, R&D is a generic thing. Understand here at Unity, we have a really clear understanding of things. For example, the question came earlier about Art engine, across Unity, we've got a lot of AI people, and a lot of artists and R&D focused on building tools make artists more productive. I see a day not in the distant future where this isn't a feature and I am promising to developers out there, this is not happening today. But it's where we're going intellectually, and we're building towards, maybe they've designed redwood for an Elm for us. And so you take training data of a couple 100,000, or a couple 10,000 photos of Elm for us and you don't have to do any work, the AI transformed redwoods to Elm and all the surrounding infrastructure of a forest of that type. The point of it is, is that computers today are powerful enough to do so much more for artists and they're doing now. Now some of the things I've described are already possible, I could dazzle you if you came into the office and show you some of the things that are happening with some of the smartest engineers and AI technologists in the company. Across half a dozen priorities like that, we are very clear about what we're building, why we build it, how it connects to a community of users, and putting dollars and cents on it, how many of them there are and what they might pay for it. And it's what occupies a great part of my time, and that of senior leaders like Ralph, on the R&D side, Mark and Ingrid leading our operate teams and Jeff, our R&D leader. A lot of focus on just this question, right. That's a good wrap up, it kind of explains, encapsulates what we do. So John, if you have any wrap up questions, otherwise, we can stop here, whatever you'd like. Thank you so much, everyone."
