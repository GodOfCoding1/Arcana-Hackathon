    "content": " We achieved nearly $2 billion in total net sales in the fourth quarter, up more than 14% on a per day basis year-over-year as higher average selling prices for our products drove sales growth in all three lines of business. We are continuing to invest in projects related to our sales organization, customer experience initiative, pricing tools, e-commerce and branch optimization -- these and other Ambition 2025 investments totaled approximately $11 million within the operating expense line in the third quarter.
