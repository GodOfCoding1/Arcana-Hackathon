    "content": " As you look at volumes throughout the year on non-res, as I mentioned, I think in an answer to an earlier question, the second quarter 2021 volume comp is the strongest in the last four years, and the only reason I say four years is because I only went back four years. We do think that whether it's greenfields, which we've got an air pocket, and we're going to invest in, whether it's the M&A component, then we can bring specialized skills to help those companies that we acquire grow more than they had been in the past, as well as specialized services, digital platform, all of those things that we can do that are differentiated we believe will help us drive growth as well\n That was good. And I do think, as I mentioned earlier, you've got some other trends that are impacting demand, particularly on the residential side, with this idea that insurance companies say that we're not going to ensure a house on a transaction if you haven't got a new roof because the roof is over 12 years old. So as houses turn over, we're probably getting more of them today getting reroofed than you have in the last 10, 15 years, so combined with the reroof cycle, combined with these other trends that are suggesting that there's -- that you need to replace a roof if you get a new house because that's what the insurance companies are saying. We see it in residential in the commercial roofing business and in the complementary business, and we think there's more room to grow as we indicated in our Ambition 2025 plan that we intend to grow to at least $1 billion business over the next several years."
