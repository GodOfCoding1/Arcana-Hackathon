Yes, I think that what we said last time around was that we estimated that the inventory profits we saw represented about a 90 basis point benefit that we've seen going forward and that it would eventually start to roll off, assuming that there were no more price increases that were announced, and we weren't going to continue to benefit. Then we thought at the start of the year, we've continued to see those inventory profits as we've taken advantage of timing of the price increases, making sure that we're in a great spot as we go forward, and we think that's actually a good part of how we manage the business and thinking about generating those inventory profits by buying at the right time at the right price in the marketplace."
