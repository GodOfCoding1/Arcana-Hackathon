    "content": " In addition, we will continue to invest in our industrial wastewater business to build our volume sales by investing in new product innovation, personnel in key markets, including China and India, and the increased local marketing efforts to stay on track of our $30 million to $70 million revenue goal for 2026, we must significantly grow industrial wastewater revenue in 2023 and 2024. This year, we are trending to roughly 48% to 49% of revenue based on our original revenue guidance or approximately $63 million to $64 million in OpEx when excluding those one-time expenses. Sales and marketing spend will likely remain elevated over the next year or two, but should begin the fall to a more normalized range of 5% to 10% of revenue as we realize revenue for our new business plan."
