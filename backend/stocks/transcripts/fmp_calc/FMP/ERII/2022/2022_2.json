    "content": " At the end of the second quarter, we had already exceeded 2021 revenue by 60% and are well on our way to meet our forecast of $3 million in industrial wastewater revenue for fiscal year 2022. Total OEM revenue for the year includes $1.6 million in industrial wastewater sales, which as Bob mentioned is on pace to achieve our full year guidance. Therefore on adjusted and recurring basis, OpEx grew 15% year-on-year, largely driven by sales and marketing as we naturally grow spend from our COVID lows and focus on building our industrial wastewater and CO2 business."
