    "content": " Let\u2019s start with our industrial wastewater business, where we achieved revenues in the first quarter equal to nearly 50% of 2021\u2019s full-year industrial wastewater revenue. Our 12% year-over-year revenue growth this quarter was largely driven by our OEM and aftermarket channels, both of which exceeded Q1 2021 by 67%, while our mega project channel remained flat against last year. Due to our slightly higher gross margin and decreasing OpEx as a percent of revenue, we saw healthy growth in our operating income to $8.2 million, or 34% year-on-year growth, and we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $11 million, or 23% growth year-on-year and 34% of revenue."
