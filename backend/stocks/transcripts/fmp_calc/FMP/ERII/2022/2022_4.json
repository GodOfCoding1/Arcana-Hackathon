    "content": " Gross margin of 69.6%, exceeded 2021 full year by 100 basis points; OpEx as a percentage of revenue, when adjusted for one-time costs, was 48%, its lowest level in nearly 14 years. We generated nearly $4 million of wastewater revenue in 2022, nearly 30% over our target for the year. We generated $121.6 million in desalination revenue and nearly $4 million in industrial wastewater in 2022, for a combined total growth of 21% for the year. Desalination OEM revenue, excluding industrial wastewater, grew nearly 50% to $25 million, exceeding our previous annual high in desalination OEM sales by 9%. We continue to expect desalination revenue to be heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarters, with up to 70% to 80% of revenue occurring in the second half of the year. I mentioned during the last call that sales and marketing would increase 30% to 40% this year, pushing this spend to 17% to18% of revenue. In addition, based on our first and second quarter shipment expectations, we should see lower than normal cash and investment balances by the end of the second quarter, possibly falling to a range of $70 million to $80 million, which should subsequently rebound in the second half of the year."
