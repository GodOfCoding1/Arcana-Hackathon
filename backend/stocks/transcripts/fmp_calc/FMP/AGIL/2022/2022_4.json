    "content": " We reported a solid fourth quarter for 2022 with revenue totaling $43.1 million above our guidance, representing a 2.3% year-over-year growth. And with it, we totaled $176.8 million in revenue for the full year 2022 representing 11.5% organic year-over-year growth. If we exclude the revenues from these two clients in 2022, our overall organic revenue growth was 20% plus year-over-year in 2022. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $43.1 million, representing 2.3% year-over-year growth. For the full year, revenues totaled $176.8 million, above our guidance and representing 11.5% organic year-over-year growth. As Manuel mentioned earlier, this growth is 20% plus organic year-over-year, if we only exclude the revenues from two professional services clients that have been declining, but where we no longer see a big exposure. Adjusted net income for the full year 2022 was $2.7 million, representing 1.5% adjusted net income margin, 142% improvement year-over-year. Our successful efforts to exit the non-core business, as we announced a couple of quarters ago, should be completed in the first half of 2023, which along with the ramp-up of all the new sales team members should lead to strong revenue growth towards the second half of the year. We expect full year 2023 revenues of at least $201.6 million or 14% organic year-over-year growth, with gross margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Thank you, Mr. Senderos. Thank you, Mr. Senderos."
