    "content": " Overall, this has been another strong quarter for AgileThought, with revenue totaling $43.4 million, above our guidance, representing a growth of 7.4% year-over-year despite continuing to exit the noncore business, as announced on our previous earnings call. Revenues for Q3 were $43.4 million, above our guidance and represented 7.4% year-over-year growth, but down 6% compared to the previous quarter. Our revenues per billable employee as of the last 12 months ended September 2022 was $79,000 compared to $71,000 as of the same period of the prior year, representing 10.5% year-over-year growth. We now expect our full year 2022 revenues to be at least $176 million in constant currency, representing at least 10.9% year-over-year growth versus prior expectation of full year revenues of at least $174.7 million, representing 10% year-over-year growth. Just to add to Manuel's point, even net-net despite getting out of -- or despite continuing our efforts to get out of noncore accounts on an overall growth basis, next year should be a faster growing year for us compared to 2022 and then to the earlier question about gross margins as well. And year-over-year, thinking of that, call it 100, 150 basis point improvement in gross margin, that's a good way to think about our business."
