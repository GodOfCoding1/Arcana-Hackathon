    "content": " We achieved a 30% return on invested capital, strengthened our balance sheet by repaying more than $370 million in debt and returned $90 million in cash to shareowners. We generated $84 million in free cash flow, and adjusted operating earnings of $1.97 per share, which was more than double the adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect volume to decrease slightly by $5 million to $10 million, reflecting seasonally weaker volume in Latin America and continued inventory corrections in Europe and North America. We will also invest $30 million to $35 million in Brazil forestry, about a 10% year-over-year increase, to ensure long-term availability of sufficient volumes of low-cost wood, which are a critical component of our competitive advantage in Latin America. In 2023, we expect to generate $760 million to $840 million in adjusted EBITDA, and $300 million to $330 million in free cash flow. And that's what, as you know, we fully utilized that and returned $90 million back to shareowners in either in form of dividend and also in terms of share buybacks. And so, we're working on different options that we'll be reviewing with the Board and we're going to be -- our intent is to get flexibility, so that we could increase what we can return back to shareowners above the $90 million. So, I guess the short answer to your question is, yes, I think the range that we talked about earlier the $175 million to $190 million for maintenance, regulatory and forestry is probably -- what we feel is the appropriate number going forward."
