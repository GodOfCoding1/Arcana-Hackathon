As mentioned earlier, we generated an adjusted EBITDA of $189 million, which was an improvement of 29% over the first quarter. We generated $39 million in free cash flow, up 22% quarter-over-quarter and delivered adjusted operating earnings per share of $2.02, which is up 51%. We delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $335 million, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.3%. As Jean-Michel mentioned, we generated $189 million in adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 20.7%. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $205 million to $215 million. As you can see on the slide, we have repaid $225 million in debt since our spin, and we have steadily driven down our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio every quarter."
