    "content": " With the strong resurgence of Brick-and-mortar traffic online, organic sales growth in the Americas declined single-digit against the sharp increase last year, while organic online penetration remains solid at 31% of sales. In our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region, organic net sales rose 19% with virtually every market contributing to growth led by the emerging markets in the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia, as well as the U.K. By channel, the region saw more balance between brick-and-mortar and online growth. Sales growth in Mainland, China was somewhat slower due to COVID restrictions during July and August and the pace of online sales growth slowed following the successful 6-18 programs last quarter, and in anticipation of the 11.11 Shopping Festival. It's incredibly strong, the brand does a fantastic job of innovating and so we're seeing growth from both new innovation as well as a continued expansion of new consumers with some of the strategies that the brand is deploying."
