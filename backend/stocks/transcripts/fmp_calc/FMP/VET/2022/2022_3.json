    "content": " As shown on Slide 7, we have updated our 2022 pro forma financial outlook to incorporate this windfall tax and now forecast pro forma fund flow of $2.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion or over $9 per share, which implies a free cash flow yield of in excess of 30%. At current pricing, these two wells have generated approximately $30 million of operating cash flows, recovering 40% of the invested capital in the first two months on production. At the end of the day, depending on the national measures that are adopted by the EU member state as well as the financial years, which measures will be applicable that's where we're basically just applying the EU framework at this point to get that estimate of $650 million to $750 million of two-year cumulative impact. I think that, the $1.2 billion debt target was going to be a nice landing spot at the end of 2022 in terms of being able to go lower than that in 2023, as well as being able to return capital. And then also, just back to the accounting and how it's pay and all that stuff, again, back to like if you're exiting with $1.6 billion this year on net debt, and you're looking at production into 2023, if it's a similar level, I guess, and what people have out there for estimates, it looks like cash flow generation should be fairly robust. And given the total size of the windfall tax is estimated and the net debt exiting this year, does the -- is it still feasible for you to reach your net debt target next year, that's sub-$1 billion and you're back to in that range of free cash flow generation and being able to pay out 50% or so of the free cash flow into 2023 once the buybacks are resumed."
