    "content": " Our revenue growth continued to accelerate in Turkey, but mainly with the impact of Ukrainian operation, group top line growth in the fourth quarter was just over 57%, slightly above third quarter growth. Despite the heavy inflationary pressure on the cost base, our EBITDA grew by 46% to TRY22 billion, bringing the margin to 40.8%, implying just 1% contraction year-on-year, thanks to the disciplined cost management. In the fourth quarter, the revenue of digital OTT service rose 71% year-on-year, driven mainly by price adjustment in TV, cloud storage and music streaming services, as well as 28% overall growth in the standalone paid user base. Taking into account our plans for the year as well as the initial assessment of the earthquakes impact, we set our revenue growth target to 55% to 57%, EBITDA guidance to around TRY 34 billion and expect a CapEx intensity around 22%. In the fourth quarter, group EBITDA was 58% year-on-year to TRY 6.7 billion, driven by a strong top line performance as well as pivotal cost management. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
