    "content": " In the first half of the year, revenue has increased by 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA has increased by 3.7% on a comparable basis, while CAFD growth has been 6.7% up to $117 million. In North America, revenue increased by 11% to $199 million in the first half of 2022, while EBITDA increased by 19%, thanks to the asset we had recently acquired the United States. In fact, if you look on this page at the CAFD before debt principal repayments, you can see that, that was $255 million for the first half of the year, more than twice the CAFD generated in the same period. What we see is that, in fact, both net project debt and total net debt have decreased by more than $300 million in the first half of 2022, showing that, in our case, equity value creation happens through CAFD and dividends but also happens through the significant debt repayments that we are doing every quarter."
