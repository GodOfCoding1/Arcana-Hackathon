    "content": " Regarding growth this year, we have already closed or a earmarked investments between $140 million and $150 million, including acquisitions and construction of new assets, new renewable energy plants. Revenue in the first 3 months of 2022 reached 400 -- $247.5 million, which represents a 7% growth on a comparable basis. Regarding cash available for distribution, we generated $54.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 6.3 year-over-year. In North America, revenue increased by 23% to $74.4 million in the first 3 months of 2022, while EBITDA increased by 45%, thanks to the recently acquired assets in the United States. In the first months of 2022, we have closed or earmarked investments between $140 million and $150 million, including the $57 million in acquisitions. So I think where we -- that $300 million to put to work on a yearly basis, I think that's the target we are shooting for this year. One, regarding what, you would call third-party acquisitions, if you want, the money we invest every year, in purchasing assets from third parties, we do believe that if we look forward, the market should be constructive for companies with our profile, meaning companies with a balance sheet, company with a track record, and companies that are probably a bit more conservative than others."
