    "content": " In the ongoing pivotal China-only trial for CBP-201 in AD, we received feedback from China Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, that led us to review the data from the first 255 patients already enrolled in our Stage 1 16-week treatment period. The Phase 3 data set will also provide evidence on CBP-201's ability to maintain clinical improvement in patients who stepped down to a more convenient treatment regimen of 300-milligram given every four weeks for long-term use, which is part of our overarching goal of demonstrating the potential differentiated therapeutic benefits of CBP-201 for patients with AD. This increase was driven primarily by higher clinical trial-related expenses, including expenses related to advancing CBP-201 for AD in China, the ongoing global Phase 2 costs for CBP-201 in asthma, our global Phase 2 trial cost for CBP-307 in UC as well as higher personnel costs for additional R&D headcount. Then in our discussion with CDE, based on their reply our questions, it certainly appear to us, and we believe, that the CDE want to see how the data set looks like and because we already have a global Phase 2b trial, and on top of that, we built this China pivotal trial, in terms of the designs and the purpose, it's entirely consistent with the pivotal trial."
