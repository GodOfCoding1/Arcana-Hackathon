During this call \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry, during our call this morning, Paul Brink, President and CEO of Franco-Nevada, will provide introductory remarks followed by Sandip Rana, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a brief review of our results. While inflation impacted the margins of many operating companies, our EBITDA margins actually expanded slightly and our business generated record profits. It was a relief I am sure for everyone last week, when First Quantum and the government reached agreement on a refreshed contract. For 2023, our precious metal GEOs and our diversified production are expected to be consistent with 2022. We are looking forward to Cobre Panama reaching its expanded throughput capacity of 100 million ton per annum by year end and also to initial contributions from 3 new gold mines during the year, Magino, S\u00c3\u00a9gu\u00c3\u00a9la and Salares Norte. The most significant new additions during the period are expected from Tocantinzinho, Vale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Southeastern Iron Ore Systems and Hardrock in Ontario. Our business development team is seeing good opportunities for precious metal financings, in particular, financing new gold mines. To wrap up, Franco-Nevada has no debt, $2.2 billion in available capital, and in these uncertain markets, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be better positioned to continue its growth record. As mentioned by Paul, Franco-Nevada ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter, resulting in record financial results for the full year. However, revenue and earnings were impacted by weaker precious metal commodity prices and timing of deliveries for certain assets. As you turn to Slide 4, you can see how the company performed against the guidance that was issued for 2022. The initial guidance provided by the company for the year was 680,000 to 740,000 total GEOs sold. Of this total, we guided to 510,000 to 550,000 precious metal GEOs with the balance being from diversified assets. The company ended the year with 729,960 total GEOs sold which is at the high-end of the guidance range. However, we were at the lower end of the range for precious metals with just over 510,000 GEOs sold. This was due to lower GEOs than expected from Stillwater, Antamina and Cobre Panama, with a portion of the lower GEOs being related to price impact on conversion of non-gold commodities to GEOs. This resulted in coming in ahead of our expected guidance with 219,575 total diversified GEOs. On Slide 5, we highlight the gold equivalent ounces sold for the last five quarters as well as the previous 5 years. Overall, GEOs sold were relatively flat when compared to prior year with Q4 2022 GEOs sold being 183,886 compared to 182,543 in fourth quarter last year. Of this, precious metal GEOs were 129,642, down 6.6% from prior year. For the quarter, the largest contributors to the lower precious metals were Cobre Panama, Antapaccay and Guadalupe. At Cobre Panama, First Quantum had another strong quarter as it moves towards production of 100 million tons per year. However, for the quarter, due to timing of shipments, gold and silver deliveries and ounces sold were lower than expected for the company. As we look to Q1 2023, we do expect a delay in precious metal deliveries from Cobre Panama due to the temporary production curtailment that did occur. Antapaccay delivered less ounces than prior year, but was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the operator at Guadalupe mined less ounces on lands to which our stream applies resulting in lower GEOs delivered. Partially offsetting the lower precious metal yields from these assets mentioned were Hemlo and Tasiast, where we had strong fourth quarters. For diversified GEOs, our Vale royalty resulted in just over 4,000 GEOs for the quarter. As you know, each quarter, we make an estimate of what the royalty will be with the actual amount being announced by Vale in late March and September each year. As a result, you will see adjustments to our accruals twice a year in Q1 and Q3. The strong fourth quarter closed out the year with 729,960 GEOs sold for 2022, the highest annual level thus far for Franco-Nevada. As you see on Slide 6, most precious metal prices were lower for the quarter and the year. Energy prices were again strong in 2022, reaching multiyear highs. However, oil and especially natural gas prices have both retreated in the first part of 2023. Slide 7 highlights our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA amounts for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2022 and \u00e2\u0080\u009821. As you can see from the bar charts, revenue and adjusted EBITDA has decreased slightly for Q4 2022 compared to prior year. The company reported $320.4 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and $262.4 million in adjusted EBITDA, a margin of 81.9% was achieved. The increase was due to the continued strong energy prices, especially natural gas. West Texas Intermediate oil price averaged $82.65 a barrel in the quarter, natural gas prices increased significantly with Henry Hub averaging over $6 an Mcf in the fourth quarter compared to $4.85 an Mcf a year ago. For the full year, the company recorded $1.31 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, both records for the company. As you turn to Slide 8, you will see the key financial results for the company. Although GEOs were slightly higher for the quarter, revenue was lower because of lower precious metal prices. On the cost side, we did have a decrease in cost of sales as less stream ounces were delivered and sold compared to prior year. As we received less GEOs from Antapaccay, Cobre Panama and Vale, this impacted depletion as those assets are higher per ounce depletion assets. For the full year 2022, adjusted net income was $697.6 million. As shown, 70% of our 2022 revenue was generated by precious metals. The geographic revenue profile has revenue being sourced 91% from the Americas, with Canada and the U.S. being the largest. And with respect to asset diversification, Cobre Panama was again our largest revenue generator at 17% of total revenue, followed by Candelaria and Antapaccay. Our largest exposure to revenue being generated by any one operator is 17%, which is First Quantum who operates Cobre Panama. For 2022, the cash cost per GEO, which is essentially cost of sales divided by gold equivalent ounces sold is $242 per GEO. This amount will fluctuate depending on the mix of royalty versus stream GEOs, including mining and energy. But as you can see, at current average gold prices, the company generates significant margins. The margin was over $1,500 per ounce in 2022. In a rising commodity price environment, we expect to benefit fully as the cost per GEO sold should not increase significantly. As you can see, revenues have grown significantly over the period shown, while corporate costs have remained fairly stable. For 2022 corporate administration, including share-based comp, was $32.6 million or less than 3% of revenue. As you can see on Slide 12, for 2023, we are guiding to lower total GEOs sold with the range being 640,000 to 700,000 GEOs sold. Of this total, we are guiding to 490,000 to 530,000 precious metal GEOs for the year. We do expect higher GEOs from Antapaccay, MWS, Tasiast and Musselwhite, where the NPI should be payable for the full year. At Cobre Panama, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve guided for a range of 115,000 to 135,000 GEOs accounting for the recent production curtailment and timing of deliveries. We expect first deliveries from new mines Magino, Seguela and Salares Norte. Our guidance has been calculated using $1,800 per ounce for gold, $21 for silver, $900 platinum, $1,500 palladium and $120 per ton iron ore. Obviously, prices are volatile, and as they change, it will impact the conversion of non-gold commodities to GEOs. On the energy side, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using $80 per barrel WTI and $3 Mcf natural gas. This provides a range of 105,000 to 225,000 GEOs from our energy assets. As we look forward to 2027, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of the built-in growth that the company already has in place. Our outlook for 2027 is 760,000 to 820,000 GEOs sold. Of this range, precious metals will be 565,000 to 605,000 GEOs. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting a number of new mines to be in production by 2027, TZ, Greenstone, Valentine Gold, Stibnite and Eskay Creek. Also, we do expect McCreedy West and Sudbury to remain in production at 2022 levels until 2027. For diversified GEOs, we do expect an increase in GEOs from our Vale royalty as attributable production should increase with plant expansions. And for the energy assets, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve assumed a slight increase in production over the next 5 years resulting in a marginal increase in GEOs. Also, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve held energy prices flat at $80 a barrel WTI and $3 an Mcf natural gas for the period. Overall, when you look at the outlook for GEO sold, the company has over 18% built-in organic growth to 2027 at budgeted commodity prices. Finally, Slide 13 summarizes the financial resources available to the company when including our credit facility of $1 billion, total available capital at December 31, 2022, is $2.2 billion. And with that, I will pass it over to the operator, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to take your questions. So at a high level, obviously, First Quantum has not adjusted their guidance for the year. So from our standpoint, in Q1, we will be impacted, I would say, of our range of 115,000 to 135,000 GEOs, roughly 20% of that will come through Q1. And Paul, I mean, you were talking earlier on this call, one of your quotes was in these uncertain markets, you are still able to continue your growth, goals at $19.30 an ounce right now, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed in the past that the mass royalties and streams is quite high, though you also play in a ballpark bigger than many of the other people. No, the focus most recently has been on precious metal assets. There is a range of things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at, but the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by far, the most of it is precious metal related. By my comment, more of where I was going is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re providing capital to the mining industry, particularly the gold mining industry and the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen for the last number of years that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in a world of wash with cash and cheap capital. And that is drying up the cost of funds to many developers is higher than it was and particularly with the current liquidity issues in the market, I expect it will only go higher. Maybe my first question here is just on your 5-year outlook, starting with Vale. So Vale, as Sandip indicated at the end of this quarter, we will provide an update typically as to when they expect the Southeastern system to begin contributing. And then maybe just switching gears here, Heiko touched on this briefly in terms of the BPO environment, but that financing remains difficult to access for junior miners and developers with rising interest rates. So we are following up with others in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with that type of structure, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hopeful we will be able to do more deals like that. And that is kind of sub $400 million I would say is a mix of primary gold and byproduct but I guess, one trend is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing more and more project financing type transactions on lines of what I just mentioned. It could range my guess at this stage or my estimate is, CAD5 million to CAD7 million based on the full year production. Our assumptions reflect that the mine plan that they have put out there in their guidance, so that if they do go ahead with the underground expansion, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upside on what we are currently going. Could you explain which of your projects had bigger reserve and resource extensions, just looking down the list Detour Lake, Bruce Jack for example had reserve gains or discoveries last year. Your revenues rose 1%, but your depreciation fell 4.5%, would that imply a 5% increase to your reserve life? The big changes for the year in reserves will be Detour Lake, Cascabel, where they moved M&A into the reserve category, the next on the list is the increase in reserves that Malartic with the underground and then the new assets that we have Tocantinzinho and also Magino. And then John, just on depletion, yes, revenue was higher. But on the mining side, we did have lower production, which results in lower depletion and the lower production was from high depletion assets, Cobre Panama, Antapaccay, and Antamina. And as a result, we had lower depletion, the additional reserves and resources that will impact depletion for 2023 going forward. So obviously, the issues at Cobre Panama highlighted the benefits of First Quantum \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry, Franco-Nevada, pardon me, diversified asset base. However, I mean Cobre Panama remains a relatively large proportion of the asset base. Sandip, I think you mentioned 17% of \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And I think with net asset value or using that as a basis, it would be a bit higher. But at the same time, we are trying to expose our investors to that resource optionality and the ability for assets to expand over time. Our experience has been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big ore bodies that get better over time, that are the most likely to be expanded and often that have the longest lives and the greatest long-term potential. I have to say if there was another Cobre Panama that came along and we had the opportunity to invest in it, we would do it in an instant  to expose ourselves to that growth. And as our portfolio grows and we add more assets, so we dilute the individual influence of each of them. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if the big assets that we can bring onboard, we will do it again. We are on all aspects, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political risk, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assets, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operators, we try and diversify it. But again, if the great assets that come along, you have got to bring them onboard when you have the chance. And then just secondly, on metal mix, so gold in 2022 was about 55% of the overall revenue mix. But as we have always said, we recognize that the business is cyclical and there are times where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to invest in other commodities. We have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 last year, we are up to roughly 30% diversified. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the target, but if there were great assets that we needed to bring onboard that were diversified and we are at that level, we are comfortable with that. So, the first one maybe just to finish off with Sandip if I could, on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just looking at the year, Sandip, you mentioned Q1 is going to be weaker on Cobre Panama because of the shipment coming through 20% of that annual production. On Vale, we have always guided that production is usually less in the first six months of the year versus the second six months. Can you just give me an idea in your 2027 number, walk, I mean Stibnite would be about 8,000 GEOs. And then just lastly on transactions, and thank you for the color on looking at both project development, both on precious metal and also on byproduct credits from other producers. As I say, on the diversified side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about are they great assets, often we look at it and say, are there things that we can do in diversified assets that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do in gold. I think great ore bodies or ore bodies with very long lives, those are the sort of things we are looking for. But if there is a great lithium deposit and we could get a deal done based on longer term prices where we can honestly believe there is more upside than downside, we would be interested in doing something. On energy, we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you know, we have guided to 20% is where we are comfortable on energy. Obviously, when prices run as they did last year, then energy gives you a greater contribution. So, at our current levels, we are not looking to add more energy. But no bright line in the sand, in due course, if it was a lower percentage of our portfolio, we may consider it again. So, the terms that have been negotiated and there is a draft agreement on principally related to the taxation on First Quantum or MPSA, the entity that operates in country. For us to do well over time in the asset, you are obviously hoping that the operators will spend capital and expand the asset over time, spend money exploring the asset. We expect to release our first quarter 2023 results after market close on May 2nd, with the conference call held the following morning."
