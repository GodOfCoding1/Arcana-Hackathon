    "content": "  Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Franco-Nevada Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call and Webcast. This call is being recorded on August 11, 2022. . I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bonavie Tek, Vice President, Finance. Accompanying this call is a presentation, which is available on our website at franco-nevada.com, where you will also find our full financial results. During our call this morning, Paul Brink, President and CEO of Franco-Nevada, will provide introductory remarks; followed by Sandip Rana, Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a brief review of our results; and Eaun Gray, Senior Vice President, Business Development, who will provide an overview of our Tocantinzinho transaction. We would like to remind participants that some of today's commentary may contain forward-looking information, and we refer you to our detailed cautionary note on Slide 3 of this presentation. Each of revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income were records for the quarter. Our top line precious metals stream and royalty interests helped generate our highest ever margins since adding streaming to our business, over 85% for adjusted EBITDA and 55% for adjusted net income. High energy prices in this environment are positive for us and drove an increase in our diversified GEOs, partly offset by marginally lower precious metal GEOs sold. At half year, our total GEOs sold was slightly ahead at the midpoint of our guidance range, and we're maintaining our previously issued guidance. In July, we were delighted to announce the financing package for the Tocantinzinho property in Brazil with G Mining Ventures for $353 million. The financing package included a $250 million gold stream, $75 million term loan and a $27.5 million equity financing. The team behind G Mining Ventures is well known in the industry for its record of building mines on time and on budget, including Merian for Newmont Mining and Fruta del Norte for Lundin Gold. We expect Tocantinzinho will be the first of many mine builds for the company, and have ended into a long-term partnership for future financings and acquisitions. Agnico Eagle announced a 10-year mine life extension to 2052, and they're looking to expand throughput to 32 million tonnes per year as well as potentially develop an underground mine that could increase production to 1 million ounces or more per year. The Detour expansion, along with expansions at Stillwater and Tasiast and, of course, Cobre Panama, form the core of our near-term organic growth. We'll also have contributions from 3 new mines in the next couple of years and the construction of Salares Norte, Greenstone and are all proceeding on track. With respect to ESG, during the quarter, Franco-Nevada was named the Corporate Knight's 2022 List of the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada. Also as part of the Tocantinzinho transaction, we committed $1 million of environmental and community support programs over 4 years. In summary, Franco Nevada continues to deliver with record financial performance, built-in growth and long-term optionality. We're cash flow positive with no debt, of $1.9 billion in available capital and generating operating cash flow at a rate of $1 billion per year. As Paul mentioned, the company reported record financial results for second quarter 2022 with our overall royalty and stream portfolio performing ahead of expectations. On Slide 4, we've highlighted the gold and gold equivalent ounces sold to 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Overall, GEOs sold were relatively flat when compared to prior year with Q2 2022 GEOs sold being 191,052 compared to 192,379 last year. You may recall that in Q2 2021, we did record 2 quarters of GEOs and revenue related to the Vale Royalty we had just acquired. This would have equated to an additional 7,600 GEOs and $13.8 million of revenue recorded in Q2 2021. Overall, most assets performed as expected during the quarter, with less GEOs delivered by Antamina, Antapaccay, Guadalupe and Stillwater versus prior year. As we have highlighted previously, 2022 is a lower production year for Antapaccay as the operator is mining through a lower grade zone. For Antamina, we expected 2022 to be a more normalized year similar to previous years with a range of 2.8 million to 3.2 million silver ounces being delivered, which is what is transpiring. Unfortunately, the Stillwater mine was impacted by a significant flood event in June, which resulted in the suspension of operations at the mine. One of the surprises in the quarter was the Hemlo MPI, which was ahead of our expectations coming in at CAD 10.5 million. As we've mentioned previously, it is difficult to predict what the NPI payments will be on a quarterly basis. For the diversified GEOs, our Vale Royalty resulted in 5,407 GEOs and $10.1 million in revenue for the quarter. Each quarter, we make an estimate of what the royalty will be with the actual amount being announced by Vale in late March and September each year. For our energy assets, GEOs doubled year-over-year as we benefited from continued higher energy prices. Slide 5 highlights our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA amounts for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. As you can see from the bar charts, revenue and adjusted EBITDA have increased year-over-year for both periods. The company recorded $352.3 million in revenue in second quarter and $301.2 million in adjusted EBITDA, which are both records. The WTI price averaged $108 per barrel during the quarter, a 63% increase from prior year. Oil prices have pulled back recently to approximately $90 a barrel, but are still significantly ahead of last year. As you turn to Slide 6, you'll see the key financial results for the company. Some key financial metrics: revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income are records for the company for both the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2022. On the cost side, we did record a lower cost of sales amount in Q2 2022 as lower stream ounces were delivered and sold. With lower mining GEOs sold in the quarter and relatively flat energy production, this resulted in less depletion being recorded. With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.7%, which is slightly higher than the rate we have trended to previously. Adjusted EBITDA was $301.2 million for the quarter, while adjusted net income was $195.8 million, a 7% increase over 2021. Adjusted net income per share was $1.2 per share, a 6% increase compared to prior year. Slide 7 highlights the continued diversification of the portfolio, which we consider one of the strengths and differentiators of Franco-Nevada. As shown, approximately 70% of our Q2 2022 revenue was generated by precious metals. The geographic revenue profile has revenue being sourced 91% from the Americas, with Canada and the U.S. being 42%. With respect to asset diversification, Cobre Panama was our largest revenue generator at 18% of total revenue for the quarter, followed by Candelaria. Our largest exposure to revenue being generated by any one operator is again 18%, which is first one who operates Cobre Panama. For second quarter 2022, the cash cost per GEO, which is essentially cost of sales divided by gold equivalent ounces sold, is $238 per GEO. The amount will fluctuate depending on the mix of royalty versus stream GEOs, including mining and energy. But as you can see, at current average gold prices, the company generates significant margins. In a rising commodity price environment, we expect to benefit fully as the cost per GEO sold should not increase significantly. Here, we've highlighted our quarterly revenues and our quarterly corporate admin and share-based compensation expenses since our IPO. As you can see, revenues have grown significantly over the period, while corporate costs have remained fairly stable. For Q2 2022, corporate administration, including share-based compensation expense, was $5.8 million or less than 2% of revenue. We are guiding to 680,000 to 740,000 total GEOs sold for 2022, of which precious metal GEOs are estimated to be 510,000 to $550,000. I will now turn it over to Eaun Gray, our Senior Vice President, Business Development, to review our recent transaction with G Mining Ventures. We're delighted to be partnering with G Mining Ventures, a team that has successfully and, quite frankly, provided one of the best track records delivering similar projects in South America. The project is conventional from a technical standpoint has good grades and is located in Par\u00c3\u00a1, Brazil, a season mining jurisdiction. Franco-Nevada's participation is primarily through a $250 million gold stream, but we'll also be providing a $75 million term loan as described for $27.5 million in equity alongside with La Mancha and Eldorado. This financing covers the full expected cost to build the mine, plus a buffer. Finally, as part of this financing, we will be contributing to G Minings' efforts to support communities and the environment with the commitment of up to $1 million over 4 years. On Slide 13, we highlight our available capital of $1.9 billion. Equity valuations of line developers are particularly depressed at the moment in this high inflation environment, we believe we can put capital to work with good developers on good projects. I guess they had the flood in late June, and it's very unfortunate, but I don't think there are any injuries or anything of that nature. I don't know if they have restarted it or are close to, but the impact on our GEOs would be approximately -- if they do start in Q3, approximately 2,000 GEOs. In terms of your updated price assumptions, I just wanted to drill down upon intended on oil and nat gas for that matter. Obviously, prices have fallen from the recent peaks because of Chinese lockdowns, other demand destruction and -- combined with expectations of further demand erosion as the economy deteriorates. Just based on your conversations with your partners and the production plans that you've seen, I know you raised your WTI full year assumption by $5 a barrel. Yes, it's Jason here. I think -- for oil, we've seen a steep run-up in oil prices over a number of months here. But even before that, there was a run-up in prices really that was, I think, attributable to an underlying supply deficit. Some of that premium has come out, as you point out, over the last month or so here as COVID concerns continue in China and the overall sort of negative impact to the economy become apparent. Going forward, we still think that prices will remain strong for a while here. The impact that we've seen on operators is drilling rates and activity rates, particularly in our U.S. operations have been strong. So I'd say, looking at it holistically, we're probably 70%, 75% of those peak activity levels. And we'll keep an eye on where those activity levels go up, but are still disciplined in how they are deploying capital. And so I don't expect it to be a strong ramp up here, but I would say it will continue to be robust. I think if you see very strong commodity prices, activity levels, inevitably will creep up towards those highs. But if commodity prices are in the below kind of $90 a barrel range, I don't think you'll see activity rates come back to where they were at their peak levels, which would imply significant growth in overall production volumes in the U.S. But that's a guess, obviously, on our part. I saw it -- maybe a comment, our industry has become more competitive, no doubt about it. So the real question is, how do you progress the business in that sort of environment, and best you all turn to Eaun Gray. In this environment, as I mentioned a moment ago, we do see some stress in the capital markets for miners, and that drives opportunity. That really does drive kind of more medium-sized deals, but we think it's a good place to focus the majority of our efforts. But at the moment, equity markets remain pretty tough for medium to smaller developers, and that's an opportunity. Congratulations on the G Mining deal as well for the project, obviously. Obviously, with Tocantinzinho, it was only partially for the stream, 9 figures of money were spent on a term loan and the equity private placement. Obviously, again, you went into a term loan of a private placement as opposed to a stream for at least part of the money with the big thing being the stream nonetheless. it was important, I think, in the current capital environment to provide a fulsome solution. That's entirely possible should the capital markets remain challenging, where you bring a few groups together to complete the picture. And then the other end of the spectrum, geopolitical risk factors have become quite a bit more important in 2022 than they've been in many years. We just had another Minister of Mining and Energy in South America, who joined the fray literally in May, who's hopefully against mining. You got 49% of our revenue tied to Mexico, Central and South America. As we think of our portfolio, one of our greatest strengths is diversification. It's just a question of what's the dollar exposure that you have to each of them, and is that a reasonable amount in the context of our portfolio. Yes, obviously, what's happening in the region means you're a bit more circumspect about it. But also what we've seen over time, and quite honestly the same applies to Canada and the U.S. and elsewhere. More so as I mentioned, just holding them out, that is palpable in the context of our portfolio and happy to ride out the bumps along the way. I wanted to -- well, first of all, about the pipeline. Not to say that the other opportunities don't exist, but I would say they're probably more focused on the primary product. Also when operator is building assets, so much more important because your -- the performance of the asset is sort of dependent on that capability of bringing it on in time. We've been very fortunate, I got to say. A theme that's played out for Franco over the time is, over time, good assets move into even stronger hands. That's an interesting comment you just made, that last one. Also just as we all know, you look at any asset in the industry, any company, there's a great amount of turnover. And we feel if you get the assets right, if you invest in good assets, the chances are they migrate into even stronger hands over time. And then following up on our other question regarding South America, I was actually thinking about one particular country you do not have a lot of exposure to in South America is Argentina. They -- no surprise to anyone on the call, the geology is fantastic. If the opportunity came up, we would spend a lot of time on it, that's for sure. Obviously, it's a lot harder to predict because of the cost structure, it's an NPI. Whether that comes to fruition or not, time will tell, but that's the only guidance I can give you. And just looking out for Q3 and Q4, is it safe to assume we've got obviously the 2,000-ounce Stillwater hand up sort of normalizing. Historically, Q4 has been a strong quarter for us. For Q3, the one part that we're not aware of yet is the Vale debenture payment that will get announced on September 30. So obviously, we've made accruals for our royalty there. But if the dividend that Vale is paying comes in higher, we would make that adjustment in Q3. So all things being equal, yes, Q4 will likely be a little stronger than Q3, but Q3 does have that Vale adjustment, you accrual that, that will come through. And maybe I can circle back just on the M&A environment and maybe someone can help me understand, you -- number one, I think was mentioned that there are medium-sized deal opportunities. That's, I think, a fair characterization of what we think of as medium. And Eaun, when you are looking at these deals, which appear to be mostly on gold companies that are developing assets, should I be thinking -- again, your focus is on precious metals. I mean, beginning of the year, I started seeing just a stream and equity and now we're stream, equity and debt. The way we're thinking about it and the way we think about our business is -- and the royalty and streams are a terrific instrument, and we want to do as much of it as we can because we love the optionality that you get in it. But the other element of our business that we need to make itself successful, and I think we're good at is picking the right assets. So it's about the ability to do due diligence and take a view, which are the better assets that you think can do better over time. So if the market gets more competitive, what we've said is, let's stick to that. And then let's recognize that in this market, other elements of capital structure are hard for folks to reach. If we can get our primary objective of that stream and royalty and help them with their overall financing package, that's the approach that we're taking. And so more than anything, it's get the asset right and be flexible about how you provide the financing. Tony, it's Eaun again. We do see, on an ongoing basis, various opportunities with existing royalties. So that is a component -- but where we are spending a lot of our time, as I mentioned, is trying to work with developers. I wouldn't say there's a large number, but there are royalties like that, that exists and they trade from time to time. In terms of the Brazilian transaction you just did, production is 2 years out, it's a new operator, but they are veterans of many, many campaigns. Could you give us a little more explanation as you might consider the financing of a new mine by a new company, how many years out, you'll go, how many executives they need to have that build how many mines before -- the emerging companies can't afford the full suite of management like First Quantum or , their budgets are tight. John, you pick finger in a key industry, a key issue, it's -- the industry often suffers from a shortage of experienced folks, and we see that in particular when it comes to building projects. So something that we spend a lot of time on is looking at the ability of folks to execute, particularly on a build. Again, I won't say we put it down to an exact amount of people that they have, but we do pay attention to do they have good execution plans, do we believe that they can execute on those plans. We're not -- we're fortunate, again, in that portfolio we've got good growth over the number of years. You know in our business, none of our global rules is, on your downside case -- you put your money in on your downside case, you want to make sure that you get your money back, that's the worst case outcome, and explore yourself to the upside. It means we've got enough -- it's got to be at a of stage development where we've got enough confidence it becomes a mine and enough confidence that they are the economics and the amount of ore to -- in the downside case, at least make sure that we get our money back and expose sales to upside. So those are sort of the brackets around when we're looking at meaningful capital, what we can and can't do. If we were to contrast Franco and Nevada, say, to Cisco Gold Royalties or Sandstorm, those companies have invested a bigger slug of their capital in earlier-stage companies. The -- rather than thinking it that way, I -- we always hold ourselves out to -- I think a good part of the premium that the company to is in both 2 parts. It's -- regardless of what you do, I think if you can demonstrate to shareholders that you can make their decisions and, ultimately, get them good returns on your capital that, that feeds into your premium. So in my mind, I think those are the 2 things that are important in the company to sustain that valuation. I think there's a good likelihood of it now, and for all the reasons that you say. Eaun, you mentioned in response to a previous question that more of the streams and royalties that you're looking at are on precious metals mines rather than on base metals. I would say, first off, it's probably somewhat symptomatic of the capital markets. And then also, I think on the precious side, you do have a larger number of projects generally, kind of the size that we've spoken about. Also, base metals prices up until quite recently have been quite elevated. I mean, as the global economy weakens, obviously, base metals prices have come down quite considerably in many cases. Certainly, this is a cyclical industry and the pendulum can swing fairly quickly, and we've seen that in the past. I will now turn the Q&A session over to Bonavie Tek, who will take questions from the webcast. Our overall target is to be the go-to gold stock, which means we've got to keep the proportion of gold and precious metals in the portfolio high. We do -- the core thing behind that is markets are cyclical, opportunities come at different times. And then when good assets become available, we want to be able to do them. so that we have as much flexibility as possible so that when good assets become available, precious or diversified, that we can take them on board, but manage the portfolio so that the vast amount of it is going from precious metal over time to make sure the stock performs as a gold stock. We've been so fortunate, energy prices are doing particularly well. Right now, I think oil prices are particularly weak. Although equity markets are weak, it means some good pice-to-add assets is in the gold sector. And most likely, the next deals that we'll do will be in precious metals and we'll build up that side of business. We expect to release our third quarter 2022 results before market opens on November 7, with the conference call also held that morning."
