    "content": " And we would like to congratulate him for being recognized as the person of the year by the Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce next Friday in New York, recognizing and honoring his contribution to Global Shipping to Greece, and also recognizing the fact that TEN is the longest listed Greek company on the New York Stock Exchange, and this recognition coincides with record profitability, a record year for TEN. So, the fourth quarter of 2022 resulted in net income of over $100 million, bringing our net income for the year to over $204 million, a new record for the company since 2008. And since the end of the year, our cash reserves have continued to increase taking into account sale of vessels, Revenue in quarter four totaled over $270 million and 94% increase over the prior year. TEN has currently a new building program consisting of two plus one option shuttle tanker for delivery during 2025, four dual fuel Aframax tanker for delivery in the second half of this year and the first quarter of next, plus two eco-friendly scrubber fitted Suezmaxes that we announced today. Looking back and in view of our presentation next week, we have seen that TEN through the years has \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this year has made the net income over the last 20 years on the stock exchange of $2.3 billion in a very cyclical market and has paid dividends of\u00e2\u0080\u0093 in excess of   as our CEO said and we are looking at this trend. The solid fundamentals that I think our COO presented and I think you are all familiar with the market shows that we are in the tankers in a situation because of the lack of knowledge, of what actual  engines, our vessels should be designed or built with the lowest replacement program or newbuilding program since I've been in business in 30 years."
