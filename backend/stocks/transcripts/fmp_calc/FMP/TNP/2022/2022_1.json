    "content": " All this results in serious unrest -- public unrest with extreme social repercussions, amplifying inequality and reducing social stability, yet these environments offer also opportunities to spend with a wide and stable footprint and its resilient business model fully captures, allowing it to grow revenues, so profits, reduce debt and do all the right things, renewing its fleet with state-of-the-art vessels and doing all this in full contrast we will experience. At oil supply, we continue to -- we continuously see monthly production increases by OPEC, Non-OPEC production is set to increase in 2022, bringing more cargoes to the market at the time and global oil stocks are below the five-year levels and demand is surpassing pre-COVID levels. We had one vessel in quarter one that is classified as held for sale and was actually sold in quarter two for $21 million, with certain similar vessels under consideration for possible sale, depending, of course, on market conditions for product carriers that continue to do so well for us. And so, our finances remain in good shape and we believe we will continue to be throughout quarter two and the half year as we -- indeed as we enter the third quarter, which we expect will continue to generate strong cash flow, allowing us to further focus on debt reductions and disposal of older vessels, at the same time, enabling us to continue rewarding our shareholders as we have shown.
