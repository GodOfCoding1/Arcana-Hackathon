    "content": " In our CareVention Healthcare division, which represents our core PACE business, revenue increased 17% versus a year ago during the third quarter and 18% through the first 9 months of 2022. Excluding EMTM revenue of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, service revenue increased 13% versus a year ago, driven by our PBM and risk adjustment services, both of which increased more than 20% during the quarter versus a year ago. Third quarter product gross margin of 22.7% compares with 23.5% a year ago, with the decline driven by revenue mix and increased shipping costs. Third quarter service gross margin of 19.1% compares with 27.8% a year ago, with the decline driven by the ongoing business process outsourcing transition, including increased consulting and professional service fees. Revenue of $77.5 million to $80.5 million, which represents growth of 12% to 17% versus a year ago, including CareVention health care growth of 16% to 20%. For the full year 2022, we are raising our revenue guidance for continuing operations to a range of $294 million to $297 million, which represents growth of 13% to 14%, including CareVention health care growth of 17% to 18%."
