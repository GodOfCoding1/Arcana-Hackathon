    "content": " Our top line guidance remains unchanged, reflecting growth of 6% to 8%, though we now expect more favorable operating income growth of 12% to 16% and operating margin to increase 90 to 110 basis points based upon the continued benefits of our operational excellence and pricing initiatives. So to summarize our outlook, we now expect total Curtiss-Wright operating income to grow 3% to 6% overall, still in excess of sales growth and continue to expect operating margin to improve 10 to 30 basis points, ranging from 17.1% to 17.3%, including the headwind of the CAP1000 wind-down and first year margin dilution on the new arresting systems acquisition."
