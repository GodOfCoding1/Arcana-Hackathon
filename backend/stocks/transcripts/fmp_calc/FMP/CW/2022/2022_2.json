    "content": " New orders were strong, up 13% year-over-year, reflecting increases in Naval Defense and commercial aerospace within our A&D markets and in Nuclear and Process within our commercial markets. We are maintaining our outlook for organic growth of 3% to 5%, driven by increases in the majority of our end markets, and we now expect total sales growth of 4% to 6%, including the contribution from SAA. As Lynn mentioned earlier, our overall guidance now reflects a $40 million contribution from the SAA acquisition, and we now expect total Curtiss-Wright sales growth of 4% to 6%. Outside of our A&D markets, we raised our growth outlook for the Power & Process market to a new range of 4% to 6% based on the strong year-to-date performance and increased demand for both our Nuclear Aftermarket and industrial valve products. Our updated top line guidance now reflects growth of 6% to 8% due to improved demand within our Aerospace Defense market, supporting the F-35 fighter jet and higher electromechanical actuation sales in Ground Defense. We continue to expect operating margin to improve 10 to 30 basis points, ranging from 17.1% to 17.3%, including a $6 million increase in R&D investments, the CAP1000 wind-down headwinds and first year margin solution on the SAA acquisition."
