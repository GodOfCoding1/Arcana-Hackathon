    "content": " We delivered consolidated revenue of $643 million during the second quarter, representing an increase of 21% over last year's second quarter. If you included our first quarter performance, consolidated revenue was up 35% through the first half of the year, excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, a great start to the year and we remain optimistic about the second half. During the second quarter, digital revenue, which accounted for 39% of consolidated revenue rose over 50%, excluding movements in foreign exchange rates compared to the second quarter of last year in both the Americas and Europe. Direct operating and SG&A expenses were up 36.4%.The increase is due in part to a 49.4% increase in site lease expense to $114 million, driven by higher revenue primarily in our airport business and a $17 million decline in negotiated rent abatements. Billboard and other digital revenue continued to rebound strongly in the second quarter and was up 28.3% to $96 million and now accounts for 34.1% of total billboard and other revenue, an increase over Q1. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about, I know you called out the number of digital displays that you added, I think, but I'm just wondering the sort of the percentage growth in digital displays, presumably, that's up a lot less than the 50% revenue growth."
