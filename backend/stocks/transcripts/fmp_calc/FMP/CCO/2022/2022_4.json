    "content": " We generated consolidated revenue of $750 million, excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, in line with our guidance, and up approximately 1% as compared to our very strong performance in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, consolidated revenue was up 0.9% to $750 million, at the mid-range of our consolidated revenue guidance of $740 million to $765 million. Excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was $214 million, down 3.5% as expected, primarily due to lower rent abatements as a result of the rebound in the business. Cash paid for interest on debt was $124 million during the fourth quarter, a slight increase compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher floating rates on our term loan B facility. Overall, for the year, we expect revenue to be between $2.575 billion and $2.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $540 million and $600 million, both excluding movements in foreign exchange rates. AFFO guidance is $75 million to $125 million, excluding movements in foreign exchange rates, down from fiscal year 2022, due primarily to increased interest expense. Your line is open.
