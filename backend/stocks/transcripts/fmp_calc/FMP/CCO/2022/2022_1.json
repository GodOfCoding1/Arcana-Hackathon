During the first quarter, digital revenue runs 68% of the Americas and was up 99% in Europe, excluding movements in foreign exchange rates compared to the first quarter of last year. After adjusting for a $13 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Europe and CCIBV revenue increased $81 million during the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.
