    "content": "  Stephen Bardin: Hi, everyone and welcome to the Atai Life Sciences Third Quarter Earnings Call. I am Stephen Bardin, CFO of Atai and I am very pleased to have you with us. I am joined by our CEO and Co-Founder, Florian Brand as well as our CSO and Co-Founder, Srini Rao. Today, we will be speaking with two of our long-term analysts; Andrew Tsai from Jefferies and Ritu Baral from Cowen. Over the next 30 minutes, Andrew and Ritu will be asking us about recent progress across the pipeline and upcoming catalysts. And now for the standard reminder that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements about Atai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future results and performance, subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ. Before kicking off the interview, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll comment on the key financial takeaways included in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release. First, our Q3 operating use of cash was $28 million and was in line with expectations, so no surprises there. Next, I want to remind everyone of our previously announced debt facility with Hercules, which provides access to up to $175 million. Back in mid-August, when we closed the facility, we drew down an initial $15 million. Florian, there has been a lot of news flow around our company as of late. Great to have you back, both of you, Andrew and Ritu, on this earnings call interview format. Quickly as a recap, our ultimate goal at Atai is to achieve clinically meaningful and sustained behavioral change in mental health patients. As of today, we have 8 drug development programs in the clinics, and we also have 4 enabling technologies that we deem to be very complementary with those 8 programs. And all of those 8 programs target several major indications, neuropsychiatric indications. In addition, all of these programs have either already achieved proof of concept, in the case of COMP360, or have a path to efficacy data over the next 2 years. Looking at last quarter, very briefly, in addition to multiple clinical trial initiations, we have announced two very encouraging positive initial Phase 1 results with GRX-917, our deuterated etifoxine compound and with KUR-101, our deuterated mitragynine compounds. Both of them showed very, very intriguing PK/PD results and encourage us to drive the development of those programs further. And then last but not least, of course, we have PCN-101. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in TRD with R-ketamine, and we are very much looking forward to the data coming out of this trial around the end of this year. So our plan with PCN-101, R-ketamine, is really to be differentiated from other depression treatments on the following dimensions or elements, we are targeting unsupervised at-home administration; rapid onset of effect, within 24 hours; and we are looking or anticipating an intermittent dosing regimen, so looking at approximately two times dosing per week. And of course, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very much focused on developing this compound in treatment-resistant depression, so not MDD but TRD. Yes, the key for this program is really demonstrating data that allows at-home use. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we also like to demonstrate dissociation or sedation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and sedation profile of PCN-101 that allows that to happen, so basically to administer this compound at home without supervision. While in terms of efficacy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking, in terms of our internal product goal, to be comparable to other approved depression treatments, such as esketamine is kind of the prominent other enantiomer within ketamine. And if you do reach that, the previously disclosed target safety risk ratio of 2, I think sedation and dissociation. Basically, the risk ratio is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the way we are calculating risk ratio is very similar to what was used with SPRAVATO in their summary basis of approval. And of course, that gives you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can then take those percentages and compare them across arms. So if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20% abnormal or sedated, for example, and drug arm, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10 and a placebo arm obviously, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a risk ratio of 2. So rather than on an individual basis, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a population analysis on a pioneering basis. So severe sedation, for example, was something that they also look at. And of course, the idea, as Florian mentioned, is that we are really targeting at-home use. So we know that for sedation, there are plenty of drugs out there that are quite sedating, and in fact, sedating many-fold higher than placebo. There is less data around dissociation per se, but there is certainly data around hallucinations that can be quite prominent. Eszopiclone is a fantastic example, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lunesta. So, , it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty widely used, 0% hallucinations for placebo, 3% hallucinations on the drug. So I mean you get a sense of how prominent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from a risk ratio perspective, you see how prominent some of these side effects can be. So we are saying, okay, fine, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get a number, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get a ratio that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comparable to placebo markedly better, markedly better than SPRAVATO and put our best foot forward in that regard. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an interesting question. In the case of SPRAVATO, there was a focus on two instruments that were specifically designed to measure those particular outcomes, sedation and dissociation. So sedation, they use MOAA/S and dissociation, they use CADSS. So you have to map certain terms that the patient is using onto a term or metrics, I prefer term, and that can get a little bit complicated, using CADSS, using MOAA/S that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the entire issue. So we went back to, again, hallucination rates and things of that nature. Certainly, BELVIQ is an interesting one, BELVIQ or lorcaserin is an interesting analog. Dissociation, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get to a therapeutic index or trying to get a multiple of the therapeutic dose and results in dissociations are very analogous in many ways. So like I think you guys \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we touched on safety enough, but I do want to stay on PCN-101 because it could be a big data readout for you guys. Well, as Florian mentioned, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for ultimately in our label, based on the pivotal studies, is on the order of 4 points MADRS change at the final endpoint, which could be 4 weeks, 6 weeks, et cetera. So what should it look like considering this is a Phase 2 trial, this is a single dose study, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different formulation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our first experiment in this regard, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we kind of backtrack and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we got to 5. Also, you can triangulate on this number. So if you look at other trials of ketamine and esketamine that have similar signs, on the order of 30 patients per arm, your numbers are in the 5 kind of range, 5 to 7, somewhere in that range. So again, these are sort of the two different data points that we use to triangulate on the number. And so naturally, Wall Street tends to compare across trials. And maybe when you report the data, they might be tempted to compare what SPRAVATO shows at hour 24. So the larger studies the  2018, those types of studies are not unreasonable in terms of the size. In fact, the 0.2 mpk group was only 9 subjects. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they had many \u00e2\u0080\u0093 fewer sites, and we do well over 22 sites. They had 9, so that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how many of those are actually actively recruiting, of course. So if you look at the CADSS, the CADSS numbers for placebo were very small. So by definition, there was a very pronounced functional unwinding that was occurring in that trial that could very well sway the results. Obviously, that is not something that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating with the doses that we chose in our Phase 2a trial. On efficacy, I think you mentioned it before. So this is really a single dose study, right, of PCN-101. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to remember that this very first study is really all about testing whether \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as Srini mentioned, whether we have a greater therapeutic index compared to other approved treatment options. And regarding potential thresholds, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into any specifics, but what I can tell you is that, of course, efficacy of a single dose below what is considered to be clinically meaningful would certainly lead to us reassessing the current clinical development plan in treatment-resistant depression. But let me emphasize also that based on all the existing preclinical and clinical data that we have from third parties internally studying R-ketamine that we remain very confident to achieve the objective that we guided on, disclosed and discussed in our R&D Day in terms of trial objectives for this specific Phase 2a. And Ritu, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hand it back to you. So we conducted that trial 2 years ago now, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked at a range of doses up to 150 milligrams of 30, 60, 90 and between. And what I mean by that is we picked one dose that was sub dissociative essentially or \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then the other one \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 30 milligrams, of course. And the other one that is essentially threshold dissociative, 60 milligrams. So this allows us to properly test our hypothesis that we will have a therapeutic index, pretty much by definition, based on the results from our Phase 1 healthy volunteer study. Now to your second question about whether we go forward with additional doses, I mean, yes, potentially, of course, I mean it depends on the results of the study as well as subsequent trials. And exactly right, I mean there may be sort of different balance of efficacy and tolerability at the two different doses that may be very important, again, from a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis a particular patient that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sitting in front of them. I mean, what is driving the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how strong that data really is, but that seems to be where people have come to. However, if you think about , which is another glutamatergic compound that has NMDA antagonism, it seems to be more AUC. And so far as the half-life of dextromethorphan, the content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when buprenorphine is around is really quite long. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building up a level over the course of the first 5 days or so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4, 5 days. So in that case, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably AUC. In the end, the most important thing that we really need to get a handle on is the true bioavailability. There is not likely to be any local metabolism, for example. But nonetheless, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most important thing that we really want to assess first. And then, of course, we will look more closely at Cmax. Overall duration of effect is another one, the total time. So all these factors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, all these things will be looked into. So you may pick a dose, for example, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say 30 is effective. So they went, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed, from that IV trial to an intranasal, but they did do dose ranging around the intranasal once again. Well, at the end of the day, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just placebo-adjusted efficacy of 5 is ideally what you want to see. And then on safety, something comparable to placebo on sedation, dissociation, hallucination, something significantly less than what is provided here. And in my notes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually pretty different. Another one is a repeat dose, I believe. So, there are obviously different \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two different studies after meeting with the FDA. What I can say more broadly, however, is that the FDA is comfortable with different sorts of controls depending on the drug and depending on the indication. Really, not 100% certain. On the other hand, it is interesting. So obviously, something that we will take under advisement as we design those next trials. Is there a way to quantify or is this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is it your view that these tools serve to augment the psychedelic or \u00e2\u0080\u0093 go ahead and talk about what you think, I guess. I mean, certainly, this is an area of significant focus for us, and you guys have been with us for quite some time. The original concept behind IntroSpect really came together in late 2019 and IntroSpect itself was formed in early 2020, as I recall. The reason for that is that digital therapeutics offer a potential means of allowing for scalability but also reproducibility, if you will, or standardization of therapy. Telling the patient what to expect, setting intention, setting expectations, all these things are really critical prior to the psychedelic effect. There is this concept, of course, of behavioral plasticity that occurs after the administration of these compounds. This concept of behavioral change, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing to just change a symptom. And then SSRI, for example, can do that. So whether that behavior is improved socialization or improved exercise or something, if you have this period where there maybe more flexibility, there maybe more malleability to change some habits, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic and one should really kind of take advantage of that. So yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to us. So combination therapy being a term of art, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a drug and a device, put together, inseparable in their label. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously our vision, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we are working towards, not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, Compass has not provided guidance on how they are approaching it. Ritu, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to you on other questions about the pipeline. So the MCCB is, in fact \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has been, in fact, supported in the past by the FDA as an approval endpoint for CIAS. And actually, they have been involved or there was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or it has been developed with the FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s input \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and while the MCCB broadly assesses cognition, the VRFCAT assesses the impact of changes in cognition and function by basically simulating activities of daily living. So that basically went into also the decision, of course, around endpoints for this specific trial. And the 20-milligram, 40-milligram doses both showed clinically meaningful pro-cognitive effects, both of them. And maybe one more on that topic, I believe Biogen actually sailed with their CIAS asset this year. Presumably, you are following that asset, I guess. That, of course, is part of the appeal of this indication. Obviously, there is a huge unmet medical need here. The cost of these patients to society and, of course, the personal cost is very, very high. So even small changes in cognition and as reflected in the VRFCAT, for example, and of course, ultimately in natural actual activities of daily living, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be pretty key. So in terms of biomarker data, I will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recall seeing anything published on that personally. Already hitting the top of the 30 minutes, unfortunately, so thank you so much, Andrew and Ritu, for being with us today, really grateful that you joined again. And we covered a lot of programs in this session and that, I believe, personally speaks to the breadth of innovation that we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is happening in Atai. Looking at the last quarter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made meaningful progress, in my view, across our entire pipeline. And looking ahead, we cannot wait to share the eagerly anticipated top line results of Phase 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the Phase 2a in R-ketamine, of course. This specific dataset can be potentially, as Andrew and also Srini mentioned, be a significant event for Atai as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting an at-home therapy for treatment-resistant depression. We are, in our perspective, very well positioned to achieve additional milestones beyond R-ketamine, across all of our other programs. And that makes us very excited, and we anticipate a lot more to come over the next quarters and years. So with that, let me thank you for listening in today, everyone, and have a great week."
