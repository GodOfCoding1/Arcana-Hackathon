    "content": " Our net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $7.3 million lower than the third quarter of 2022, due to a decrease in our net interest margin from 3% to 2.53%. The $0.5 million increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 was primarily due to higher information services costs related to the maintenance and replacement of our ATMs, higher FDIC fees resulting from our larger deposit base, which were offset by lower medical benefit costs and lower commission and bonus expenses. These expectations assume among other things that; one, short-term interest rates begin to stabilize in early 2023 in-line with current market expectations; two, we continue to have success in growing deposits with promotional CDs and other products; and three, we complete our Southern California branch acquisition as anticipated this quarter. Including significantly reducing our level of loan originations, introducing promotional price deposit products, which allow us to attract and retain deposits without repricing our existing interest-bearing deposit base and entering into $1 billion of fixed rate federal home loan bank advances in the fourth quarter. Maybe it won't be, sort of 10 basis points to 15 basis points, maybe they settle in over the next couple of quarters, a little higher because of opportunities for a little more, but even if that was a 25 basis points, our current broker deposit levels are   maybe 4.25 roughly, right?"
