    "content": " Our total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $25.8 million, a decline of $4.5 million or 15% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. We had product revenue in the fourth quarter of $16.7 million, a decline of $6.8 million or 29% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Within product revenue, consumables revenue was the biggest driver of the decrease, declining $5.6 million or 33% versus the fourth quarter 2021. In Q4 of 2022, our GAAP gross profit was $12.6 million, and our gross margin was 48.8%, as compared to $16.3 million and 53.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP gross profit was $10.7 million, and our non-GAAP gross margin was 41.3% compared to $13.3 million and 47.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021. As detailed on slide 5, during the fourth quarter of 2022, our cash balance decreased by $5 million from the end of the third quarter of 2022, which was better than expected and was driven by reduced operating expenses post the restructure, improved collections on aged accounts receivable, and reduced inventory. We expect product and services revenue to range between $103 million to $109 million in full year \u00e2\u0080\u009823, representing modest growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the guidance, with a slight decline in the first half of the year and high single-digit growth in the second half of 2023."
