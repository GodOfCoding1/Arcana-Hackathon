    "content": " 82% of our first quarter revenue stemmed from neuro related offerings, up 77% compared to prior year period, driven by strong adoption of Quanterix's neuro capabilities, strong demand for our pTau-181 and neuro multiplex assays. And I think you hit it on the head, it's exactly our pharma partnerships collaborations, a big part of that obviously is that big announcements with Lilly and then follow-ons from Lilly, the ability to offer new antibodies on the neuro side and this being a very active area of research, testing, clinical testing in neurology is really going to drive that back half. All of those things are going to benefit us in the second half as people ramp and as we stay focused on resolving some of these other processes that enable us to scale and quality, that's the Lilly part of our first part of the year and I think as we get a lot of that behind us, you're going to see our ability to accelerate improve in the second half."
