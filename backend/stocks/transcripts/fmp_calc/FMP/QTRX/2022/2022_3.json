    "content": " In addition, last quarter, we made a number of changes to the way we report gross margin that we feel better reflect our current cost of quality and will provide much better visibility into the progress of the assay remediation program we recently launched. We delivered 26.6 million in total revenue, a 4% decline versus third quarter prior year but a sequential increase of 13% versus prior quarter when our quality and scaling efforts began. In Q3 of 2022, our pro forma gross margin was 35% compared to 49.8% in the third quarter of 2021, a decline of almost 1,500 basis points. As a result of reorganization actions taken in Q3 and the change in allocations to cost of goods sold, operating expenses, excluding the impact of restructuring and related expenses, decreased to 26.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, a decrease of $4 million versus the operating expenses in the third quarter of 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
