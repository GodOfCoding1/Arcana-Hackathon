We see it also from a business model perspective, very attractive because as you know, in the sort of pillar one particularly in the auto space where those can be multi-year sort of cycles from first contact to cash flow, and that has accelerated by the way I give a lot of the autos are realizing that software is very important, the cockpit is very strategic, and so they are accelerating that pace to 18 months, even a year in many cases. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start with maybe just a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost like a fundamental, the customers we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going after are major enterprises, global manufacturers, global businesses that have major reach, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re providing a software solution that can embed into millions and millions of products. One of the things we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about before, but we built a lot of the foundation of that bookings up until sort of latter part of last year, really in the backs of just a handful of business development resources, Keyvan, including going around the world, talking to these major partners."
