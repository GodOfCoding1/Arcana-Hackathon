    "content": " We continue to expect a similar profile this year as we grow more in the US where earnings are higher in the second half based on solar generation profiles, utility demand seasonality, the commissioning of more new projects in the third and fourth quarters and higher demand at Southland and the peak cooling months in Southern California. Growth in the year to go will be primarily driven by contributions from new businesses including 1.4 gigawatts of projects in our backlog coming online over the next six months as well as further accretion from our increased ownership of AES Andes, higher LNG revenues and growth at our US utilities. So as we work towards those and the timing around those, some variability, it looks like some of that may happen in say the first half of 2023, which is why we said, let's focus on $500 million this year, the remaining of the $500 million to $700 million will come in through next year."
