    "content": " In addition to UPLIFT, we have commenced patient enrollment and dosing in UP-NEXT, our Phase 3 clinical trial of UpRi monotherapy maintenance in NaPi2b-positive recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, which we believe could support approvals outside of the United States. Now let's turn to UP-NEXT, our ongoing Phase 3 trial and recurrent platinum-sensitive maintenance that is enrolling patients with NaPi2b-positive tumors and is designed to accomplish several important goals. In August, we initiated a multicenter Phase 1 trial investigating this candidate in patients with breast endometrial and ovarian cancers, we see B7-H4 as a compelling target given its high tumor expression in these indication and the limited expression in healthy tissue, the initial dose escalation portion of the trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 1660 as a single agent, and will be followed by dose expansion portion in which we'll assess objective response rate, duration of response and other measures. preclinical data have shown its potential to have a significant impact on HER2 high and low tumors, both as a monotherapy or in combination with standard of care agents such as HER2, we expect to begin patient enrollment and dosing and our multicenter Phase 1open label trial later this quarter, this trial will investigate 2056 in patients with previously treated advanced or recurrent solid tumors expressing HER2, such as breast, gastric, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer."
