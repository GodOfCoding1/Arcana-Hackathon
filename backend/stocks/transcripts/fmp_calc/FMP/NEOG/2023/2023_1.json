    "content": " Thanks to the collective efforts of the Neogen team and our new 3M team members from around the world, we are pleased to successfully close the transaction on the morning of September 1 and begin the integration of the former 3M Food Safety business with our operations. Revenues for the Food Safety segment were $64.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823, an increase of 3% compared to $62.7 million in last year's first quarter. The Animal Safety segment recorded revenues of $67.7 million for the quarter, up 3% over the $65.6 million achieved in last year's first quarter. Our operational teams are working diligently with 3M to fix their back order situation, which has slowed their food safety sales over the last two quarters by 5% to 6%. As you all know, Steve has served as Neogen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CFO since 2011, leading the company through more than 30 acquisitions, including the company's most recent acquisition of 3M Food Safety business. Food Safety to me is harder to say, because while we are entering what I think is going to be a tough environment from a recession standpoint, just -- I don't know, on the 21st, the Biden Administration announced that they were going to -- they had a $2 billion investment to strengthen global food security and they are putting $2 billion behind it."
