    "content": " Gross margin in third quarter was 49.5%, representing an increase of 470 basis points or 44.8% in the same quarter a year ago, with the increase primarily driven by the addition of higher margin business in the 3M Food Safety transaction. We're excited about the progress we've made to-date combining Neogen and the former 3M Food Safety business into a clear pure play leader in the food security market, with a product portfolio that's over 95% consumables. We were making progress and it really set us back and that's why you're seeing -- I was talking about, we're not meeting our customers demand right now on the 3M of the 3M business that we bought because the manufacturer just can't make enough for us at this point now. And that's why we're so focused on communications with the customers to make sure that the products that we have -- even though it's not enough, we're trying to work with them in a way on an allocation basis to easily make this the least painful, but we recognize this is extremely painful for our customers."
