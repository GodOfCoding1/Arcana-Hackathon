    "content": " Following the close of the transaction, which we expect will occur by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2022, our enhanced product range will mean that we will have an expanded offering in food safety, particularly in the indicative testing of pathogen detection areas which compliment Neogen's existing microbiology line. This expanded product range, along with Neogen's animal safety business, increases the solutions with which we can help customers protect the world's food supply, from behind the farm gate all the way to the dinner plate. These acquisitions each demonstrate our commitment to diversifying our portfolio and finding businesses that synergistically pair with our Food and Animal Safety segments, offering our customers around the world new products and solutions that help protect people, animals, and food; more on that later. I'm looking forward to 3M's Food Safety team joining the Neogen family, and I'm optimistic this combination will accelerate growth for products from both businesses. We also have the ability because the businesses are managed and run kind of by different leadership groups, that while yes, corporately in food safety is going to do an extremely heavy lift on the integration with 3M, the animal safety business is going to be relatively unscathed by this right because it's just the corporate resources, perhaps are going to have to do a little bit more on their own because of corporate resources are going to be pushed to work in the 3M."
