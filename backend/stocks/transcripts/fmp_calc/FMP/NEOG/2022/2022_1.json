    "content": " As you saw in our press release this morning, we're pleased to report a strong first quarter to our 2022 fiscal year, we had a 17% revenue growth across our worldwide business compared to the prior year's first quarter. Even the Brazilian real, which has devalued significantly in the last couple of years, was 3% higher against the dollar in this year's first quarter. Revenues for the Food Safety segment were $62.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 16% compared to $54.2 million in last year's first quarter. Now they're still recording strong sales of cleaners and disinfectants, but most of their growth was in genomics as our commercial dairy, swine and sheep customers all significantly increased sample volumes compared to the first quarter in the prior year. At our Brazilian operations, 2022 first quarter sales decreased 15% primarily due to a large non recurring insecticides sale to a government health organization in Nicaragua in the first quarter of the prior year. Our domestic food safety business grew 13% for the quarter, accelerating on the growth we started to see last year, as many of our customers have resumed to more normal operations. The Animal Safety segment recorded revenues of $65.6 million for the quarter, up 19% over the $55.1 million achieved in last year's first quarter. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in sales to the US companion animal market, as sample volumes were lower compared to a strong prior year first quarter. Operating income for the first quarter was $21.7 million, up 15% compared to $18.9 million in last year's first quarter with the increase the results of the higher sales and gross margins partially offset by higher operating expenses, expressed as a percent of revenue operating income was 16.9% compared to 17.3% in last year's first quarter."
