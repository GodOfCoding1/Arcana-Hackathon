Net sales were approximately $832,000 compared with approximately $462,000 in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately 80%. The significant increases in net sales, new physician metrics and inbound prescriptions as well as the increasing patient and HCP awareness of GIMOTI give us tremendous optimism for the future of Evoke and our novel intranasal treatment of diabetic gastroparesis."
