    "content": " After establishing GIMOTI's viability in the marketplace in 2021 by addressing unmet need, in 2022, we focused on the following: First, increasing the awareness of and accessing -- access to GIMOTI as a groundbreaking new treatment for diabetic gastroparesis among patients and their healthcare providers, or HCPs, and those are primarily gastroenterologists. Happily though, we're making impressive progress in convincing the diabetic gastroparesis treatment community that GIMOTI's nasal spray metoclopramide formulation is an important and needed treatment for patients instead of current oral tablet options. As mentioned in today's press release, the fourth quarter saw slight $36,000 decrease in our net product sales in the third quarter, even though we had an 8% increase in GIMOTI prescription fills. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net product sales were approximately $2.5 million compared with the approximately $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the net loss was approximately $8.5 million or $2.62 per share compared with a net loss of $8.5 million or $3.18 per share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to higher net product sales in 2022 resulting from: increased face-to-face interactions with physicians, primarily gastroenterologists, and other healthcare providers with our sales partner, EVERSANA; greater numbers of physicians within larger groups prescribing GIMOTI after their first-physician adoption; and more increased sales through our vitaCare prescription service partner."
