    "content": " Since our fourth quarter call, we have learned that Anthem experienced an occupancy decline and cost increases resulting from a surge of the Omicron variant in Q1 that may make it difficult for them to pay the full second quarter cash rent of $2.7 million. And with Anthem's expected receipt of additional stimulus funds, we still anticipate receiving total cash rent from Anthem in 2022 of approximately $10.8 million in line with prior guidance. However, we are lowering the rent we expect to receive from them in the second quarter to $2.1 million, but anticipate they will be able to make up the shortfall over the remainder of the year. Based on our recent investment activity and assumed rent payments from the former senior care and senior lifestyle portfolios, we expect our FAD payout ratio to continue to decline during 2022 and approach our target of 80% by the end of this year. However, rental revenue decreased by $1.6 million primarily due to the former Senior Care portfolio transition, partially offset primarily by increases in revenue from properties transitioned from Senior Lifestyle and the prior year straight-line rent write-off. During the first quarter, we funded a $25 million mezzanine loans secured by five communities providing a range of senior living services in Oregon and Montana. We also funded $9.5 million of a previously committed $25 million secured working capital loan to HMG, the operator to whom we transitioned the 11 former senior care properties. HMG paid back approximately 800,000 in the first quarter, leaving a balance of $18.6 million at March 31, 2022. Accordingly, we continue to anticipate receiving approximately $1 million in the second quarter, but are now expecting higher rent in the third and fourth quarter of $2.5 million in each of those periods. In connection with the sale, the current operator paid us a $1.2 million lease termination fee, which equates to one year\u2019s worth of rent. Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we acquired four transitional care centers in Texas with a total of 339 beds in mostly private rooms for $51.5 million. Subsequent to March 31, we borrowed an additional $52 million to fund the acquisition of the four transitional care centers in Texas and repaid $18 million using proceeds from the sale of the 74 unit assisted living community in Virginia. As such, the operator deferred rent of approximately $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2022 and $376,000 in April. During the first quarter of 2022, we funded $215,000 under the new $4 million capital commitment with approximately $3.8 million remaining."
