    "content": "  Interest expense increased 663,000 from last year's second quarter, mainly due to term loan originations, the issuance of 75 million of senior unsecured notes in the second quarter and higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower outstanding balance on our line of credit and scheduled principle pay downs on our senior unsecured notes. Although our debt to annualize adjusted EBITDA for real estate metric remains higher than our long-term target of below five times, we believe we will achieve this metric by year end as a result of increased rent from the properties previously leased to Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle, recent investments that we expect to start producing revenue, debt reductions from principal pay downs on our line of credit from asset sales and scheduled principal pay downs on our senior unsecured notes."
