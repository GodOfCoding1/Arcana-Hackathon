    "content": " Our FAD payout ratio was 77% for the 2022 fourth quarter, primarily due to non-run rate items, which represent the payment of Anthem's temporary rent reduction and HMG's rent increase, which Pam will detail shortly. Interest income from mortgage loans increased by $1.5 million, primarily due to mortgage loan originations in 2022 and in the fourth quarter of 2021. Interest and other income increased by $858,000 from last year's fourth quarter, mainly due to a 2022 first quarter mezzanine loan origination and working capital originations, partially offset by loan payoffs. Interest expense increased by $1.9 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to the origination of term loans in the fourth quarter of 2021, the issuance of $75 million in senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2022 and higher interest rates, partially offset by scheduled principal paydowns on our senior unsecured notes. Net income available to common shareholders increased by $5.1 million, primarily due to the net increase in rental revenue I previously discussed, higher revenues from loan originations and a decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher interest expense, the $2.1 million impairment charge and increased G&A expense. For all of the other transition portfolios with market based rents, we received 120,000 in the fourth quarter, also in line with our expectations and expect to receive $480,000 in rent during 2023. We also repaid $21 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit at a weighted average rate of 5.14%, and paid $23.3 million in common dividends, as Wendy mentioned. As I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we received repayment of Anthem's temporary rent reduction in the amount of $1.5 million, collecting $10.8 million from Anthem in 2022, which represents their full agreed upon rent for the year. We anticipate receiving $10.8 million in rent from Anthem again in 2023.We were active subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, including $128 million of investments with an affiliate of an existing LTC operating partner. Lastly, also subsequent to December 31, 2022, we borrowed $162.7 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit, primarily for investments in 2023 and repaid $7 million in scheduled principal paydowns on our senior unsecured notes at a weighted average rate of 4.5%. We are currently reviewing potential transactions for this year all off market totaling approximately $150 million, including the transaction I discussed that we expect to close shortly in spanning a variety of financing vehicles and property types."
