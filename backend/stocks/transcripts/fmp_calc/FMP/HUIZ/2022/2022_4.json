    "content": " In terms of product mix, although the pandemic limited our growth in terms of total first year premiums or FYP, facilitated on our platform, we continued to see heightened public health awareness drive a rebound in the demand of health insurance. In the fourth quarter, the FYP of long term health insurance products increased by 39.2% sequentially, benefiting from our leading market position in long term insurance and our relentless efforts to maintain a high quality user profile. While that of long term savings products increased substantially to approximately RMB46,000 during the quarter, As of December our average persistency ratios for long term life and health insurance in the 13th and 25th month remains at industry high levels of 90% and 96%, respectively. For the full year 2020, the GWP contribution of co-developed products increased by 4.6%age points year-over-year to 64.8%, which underlines our ability to identify market opportunities based on our in-depth customer insights and offer a full range of insurance products across all scenarios. In terms of FYP product mix, we are seeing a sequential recovery in the long term health insurance category and we expect that for the year 2023, our overall product mix to be more balanced between the long term health segment and the savings categories as compared to 2022."
