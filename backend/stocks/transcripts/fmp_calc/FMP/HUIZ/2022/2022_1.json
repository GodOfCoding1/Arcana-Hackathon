    "content": " And in the first quarter, our persistency ratios for in-force long-term life and health insurance policies renewals in the 13th and 25th months remained at 94% on average, a very high level compared to industry averages. And I guess three key points that I would like to answer in relating to this question will be that, most importantly, we have replenished our supply side with over 400 product as of the first quarter of this year and that encompasses the full suite of products from long-term health, savings and also property and casualty. So I think that -- I think we have been over the past two quarters been able to adjust net debts in the new regulatory regime and we have come out quite strongly with respect to the supply side of things, with respect to the online, offline presence, services and products and also the economic arrangements of the insurance companies."
