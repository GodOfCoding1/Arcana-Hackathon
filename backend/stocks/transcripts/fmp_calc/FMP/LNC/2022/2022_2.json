    "content": " Despite market headwinds, second quarter underlying earnings were solid, and we are seeing positive developments, improving group protection results, a significant sequential decline in pandemic claims and a meaningful rise in interest rates year-to-date, supporting future earnings growth and new business returns. Across these 4 businesses, our broad and diversified set of products to meet a range of customer value propositions, expanded digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience and industry-leading distribution strength position us to continue to generate profitable growth in the quarters and years to come. Interest spreads, excluding variable investment income, expanded 3 basis points versus the prior year quarter as our ongoing crediting reductions continue to take hold and the benefits of higher new money investment yields emerge. Group Protection reported operating income of $59 million up from $46 million in the prior year quarter, driven by strong top line growth, improved underlying profitability and lower pandemic-related claims. Group's disability loss ratio of 75.2% improved 230 basis points from the prior year quarter and 520 basis points sequentially, as we benefited from what is typically our seasonally strongest disability quarter and new disability claims that return to within a range of historical levels."
