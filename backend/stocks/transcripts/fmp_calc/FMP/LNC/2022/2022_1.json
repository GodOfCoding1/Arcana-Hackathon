    "content": " First quarter premiums of nearly $1.2 billion rose 4% compared to the prior year period driven by new sales, improved persistency, rate increases and employment growth. The quarter's results included pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $150 million or $0.85 per share and unusual items of $19 million or $0.11 per share, primarily related to a group protection customer to being a backlog of prior year claims. Net income for the first quarter totaled $104 million or $0.58 per share, with the difference between net income and adjusted operating income, primarily resulting from a loss related to variable annuity net derivative results. Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $55 million compared to $57 million in the prior year quarter, as strong net flows and a year-over-year increase in the equity markets were more than offset by less favorable variable investment income. Your line is open. Your line is open. But when you look at the first quarter and what we expect for the remainder of the year, I think about $100 million to $150 million of incremental capital in the new business this year relative to a normal year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
