    "content": " So overall, I think it's best which I said in my remarks to really view gross margins in Q3 combined with Q4, since we're reiterating guidance today, and as you look at Q4, we're now estimating Q4 margins of approximately 42% now which is sequential increase of 500 basis points, but 150 to 200 basis points less than the prior year, assuming the midpoint of the guidance range and this would then imply second half gross margins in the 39 percentages, and full year in the 38 percentages, which is consistent with our expectations."
