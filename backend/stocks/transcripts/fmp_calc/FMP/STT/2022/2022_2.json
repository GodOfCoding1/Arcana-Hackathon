    "content": " On the left side of the page, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see second quarter total servicing fees down 7% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business growth. Second quarter management fees were $490 million, down 3% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment, partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net ETF inflows."
