    "content": " RWA increased by roughly $15 billion or 160 basis points of CET1 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to year-end, driven by 3 factors: a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter; a strategic and temporary allocation of additional RWA capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher-than-expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed; and lastly, the RWA impact from the SA-CCR implementation that started on January 1 of this year, which we had planned for."
