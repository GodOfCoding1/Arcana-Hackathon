    "content": " We have completed a start-up and testing of our new vacuum thermal desorption system and continue to see strong market demand for the system overall, which will be an important component to DOE\u2019s mission as well as waste generated by utilities and the oil and gas industry. As a result, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to resume ultimately and significantly exceed the performance and profitability we had maintained prior to the pandemic through our increased bidding activities, waste treatment capability, expansion and the federal budget support. Our adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the quarter, as we defined in our \u2013 in this morning\u2019s press release, was a loss of $1.4 million compared to a loss of 522 \u2013 $522,000 last year. There is a couple of things that can change things along the way, depending on what waste they want to ship us and there is some debate out there, they shipped us the waste and the \u2013 that the TSCR has generated, they wouldn\u2019t even need that permit. So, I mean just kind of looking at the overall business we have survived on the services side, but not only do we see revenue increasing but also high-margin treatment business is going to become a more important mix going forward, and that\u2019s just critical as we all know. And we are in their bidding as a group and that\u2019s fine, even if we don\u2019t win the bid, though, doesn\u2019t \u2013 our facility on location opened the door for just a huge surge in potential business activity at Hanford as this $45 billion contract gets integrated, especially since we still fall under that small business umbrella."
