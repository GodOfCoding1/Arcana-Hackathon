    "content": " The decrease was primarily due to a drop in our Treatment segment revenue of about $290,000 despite a good quarter on the waste receipt side processing, as you mentioned, was impacted by supply chain, labor and inclement weather. In the Treatment segment, revenue increased slightly by $366,000 due to higher waste volume, and then offset by average \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lower average pricing as of the quarter. Your line is live. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got rates, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about rates, applying our rates to the volumes of each individual waste stream looks to be about an annual revenue of between $65 million and $75 million a year. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. The National Academy of Science recently stated that mobilizing and then solidifying with concrete in an offsite facility and bearing offsite would push treatment for over 10 years, thereby taking pressure from leaky tanks, space and facilitating movement towards building the plant to treat the high level waste."
