Your line is open. And so the comparable profit share that you\u2019re seeing in the supplemental, the 584 per certified loan on new originations in Q1 of 2022 as compared to the 680 previous year quarter, that has not been taken off yet. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
