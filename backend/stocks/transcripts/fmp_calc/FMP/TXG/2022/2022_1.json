    "content": " To make Chromium accessible to every biology lab in the world, this year's pipeline is focused on new products to drive broad adoption, remove bottlenecks and give researchers a more flexible and streamlined workflow. We have since learned there's more interest across our customer base and a lot of new customers have been onboarding with the X, since kind of later in the quarter and especially this quarter we announced that fixed RNA profiling is going to be available, specifically on the X that has spurred kind of more interest in upgrade across our entire customer base. Sure, the core labs are sort of natural purchasers as well as people on the forefront of single-cell research, but we've seen new customers coming in kind of almost by default, if they have funds certainly going for the X."
