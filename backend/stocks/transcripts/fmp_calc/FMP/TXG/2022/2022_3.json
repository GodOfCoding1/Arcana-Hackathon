    "content": " Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $131.1 million compared to $125.3 million for the prior year period, increasing 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volume of units sold and growth due to new customers, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. So as far as how we're thinking about the end of the year, we shared before that we haven't seen anything that would say that Q4 would exhibit a different kind of seasonality than we've seen in the past. First, as we roll out this kit the initial stage is getting evaluated by a lot of sort of the key opinion leaders, people who do kind of look at new technology kind of the single cell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 core single cell customers, because their opinion kind of almost matters the most in terms of influencing others to take this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're kind of in that phase right now. We're also with the nuclei -- specifically the nuclei kit and the Fixed RNA Profiling Kit you -- we have we will have now going forward more visibility into some of the halo users because this is sample prep -- at least part of these products are sampler products for customers that have been previously, we've been pretty blind to that run their core reaction centrally."
