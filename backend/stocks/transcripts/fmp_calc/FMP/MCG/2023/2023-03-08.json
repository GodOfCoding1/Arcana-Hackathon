    "content": " Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, up to $3 million quarter-on-quarter and $20 million year-on-year, as we benefited from continued strong membership and revenue growth and the start of our additional profit initiatives. We are forecasting total revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, representing 13% to 24% growth year-over-year, reflecting continued strong membership in-house and other revenue growth. Your line is open. So if you think about our houses, we have rent, we have insurance, there are other secure costs, and while we are dealing with inflation, if you think about just for membership revenues, we're guiding the membership revenues growing 30% to 34% this year, that should generate good operating leverage. Your line is open. When we look at our pipeline for this year and for next year, what we're seeing is a lot of entries into some new markets, some new kind of major city markets, which we're excited about because we see really strong potential for membership growth in those markets. Your line is open. Your line is open. So when we think about what we're seeing in terms of current trends and trends in the quarter, when we look at in-house revenue growth versus 2019 on like-for-like houses, you actually saw an acceleration in the fourth quarter. Your line is open."
