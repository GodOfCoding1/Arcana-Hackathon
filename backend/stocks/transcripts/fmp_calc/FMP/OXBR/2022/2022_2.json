    "content": " Over the long-term, we remain highly optimistic about the prospects of our core reinsurance business, our investment in a SPAC or Oxbridge Acquisition Corp. and the modest comeback of the equity markets, in effect which are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the effect of which are being seen in our positive on our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 positively in our investment portfolio. On a positive note, we had an unrealized gain of $571,000 due to positive fair value change in our equity investment in Oxbridge Acquisition Corp. We also recognized a $342,000 negative change in the fair value of our equity investment securities as of June 30, 2022, compared to a much smaller negative change of $54,000 last year. Total expenses, including loss and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs and general and admin expenses, were up through the first 6 months of 2022 due primarily to an increase in operating expenses resulting from increased personnel and other costs, including inflationary fluctuations. This ratio increased to 191.1% for the first 6 months of 2022 compared to 157.3% last year, again, due to higher general and admin expenses costs and fluctuations this year. Now turning to the balance sheet, our investment portfolio increased $600,000 to $638,000 at June 30, 2022, from $577,000 at the year-end due primarily to the net purchase of equity securities this year, partially offset by annualized losses we experienced due to the volatile capital markets. Other investments increased, as mentioned, due to the positive change in the fair value of our investments in Oxbridge Acquisition Corp. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased to $4.6 million at June 30th compared to $5.4 million at December 31, 2021."
