    "content": " Of course, we don't expect them to benefit in the placebo arm, but of course, we've also seen there can be a strong placebo effect in many trials and that's the risk of not having that arm -- it's not a comparative trial to Phase 2, but it's a reference arm to see that, what we expect is to have a very strong effect and both of the doses 25 and 50 and to have little or no effect on the attack rate in the placebo arm. And to have the information necessary to support that 2001 IND, which again, I likened to an Phase 2 meeting a far more substantial filing than a typical first in human IND, getting the full complement of clinical information, which is not just the acute exposure in the short-term editing results, but actually following these patients for some period of time is an important part of that application. Just again to draw the distinction, 2001 is a far more advanced clinical program and the nature of -- the progression of the program and that IND would be moving to pivotal programs where dose selection, see material, pivotal trial etcetera will all be part of that review, which we think will be more substantial in nature."
