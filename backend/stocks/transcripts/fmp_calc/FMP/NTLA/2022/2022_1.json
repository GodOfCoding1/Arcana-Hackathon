    "content": " So we think that the -- both by getting excellent prophylaxis for patients and also being a onetime treatment that avoids any issues, it's really continuous reduction, any issues of recovery at levels that could occur with prophylaxis, this would become the preferred treatment for patients. And based on our preclinical data and extracting somewhat from the TTR data we've accumulated so far, we're pretty confident that we'll be in a position to certainly meet and we think ultimately perhaps surpass what's been achieved for virtually any treatment modality thus far, including -- and I mean those numbers are entirely representative that you just described, but including some of the more recent data. I think people are increasingly excited about this very differentiated approach and what we and what it can bring for patients, which is essentially off the shelf, the true ability to have something there immediately, but that's also going to persist beyond the -- in our judgment, fairly poor performance of standard approaches where graphs tend to be vastly reduced and whole number within 3 to 4 weeks or completely eliminated and this we think solves that approach or that deficiency, I should say. The results that we saw with the TTR program, we think broadly speak across the in vivo pipeline, and that's something that we're very, very enthusiastic about the modular approach allows us to move that forward."
