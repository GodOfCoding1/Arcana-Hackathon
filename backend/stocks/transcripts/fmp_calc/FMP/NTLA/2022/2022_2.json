    "content": " We, of course, have been targeting very, very deep reductions, and we think that we'll be able to take what we've already demonstrate and apply it to patients in cardiomyopathy and would expect to see profound clinical benefit as a result. But because we believe we have so much room on the efficacy side that backing off the dose is a reasonable thing to do, particularly since \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as our database has grown, we've seen that it's essentially indistinguishable TTR reduction levels between 0.7 and 1.0. milligram. So we will continue to collect data, but it does look both based on our modeling and also on what we're seeing with the patients with cardiomyopathy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we do think react biologically pretty much identical to patient polyneuropathy that the TTR reduction will be the same at 0.7 mg per kg and 1 mg per kg. And again, that starts with the substantial efficacy that we have, which, again, as David has pointed out, when you look at it, 0.7 mg per kg, 1 million, as we've accumulated additional patients, we just really don't see a difference between them from an efficacy point of view."
