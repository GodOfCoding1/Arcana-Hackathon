    "content": " We have taken these factors into consideration, also in our updated full-year top line guidance for 2022, which at the midpoint reflects fast growth of 61% in GMV and 60% in revenues, a slight reduction from the previous guidance. In Q1, our non-GAAP gross profit was $29.9 million, up 94% year-over-year, representing a margin of 39.1% compared to 33.3% in the same period last year, driven by the continuous leveraging of our scale and the higher share of services revenue. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.3 million, representing a 4.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, decreasing from $5.2 million in the same period last year, reflecting the impact of Flow as well as incremental costs associated with being a public company."
