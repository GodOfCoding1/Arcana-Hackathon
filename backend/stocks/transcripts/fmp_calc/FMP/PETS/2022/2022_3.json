    "content": " Because we believe every pet deserves to live a long, happy and healthy life, we will be walking through the following components in today's earnings call: one, an update on our strategic road map, including our recent agreement to acquire PetCareRx; two, a detailed review of our full year Q3 earnings; and three, an overview of our go-forward thoughts related to our capital allocation strategy. Offering an expanded catalog to our recurring customers is a great place to start, but that alone doesn't create an adequate moat around the PetMed's business. Total consideration of $36 million, trailing 12-month revenue of $42 million, 200,000 customers, more than 10,000 brands and product SKUs, around 80 employees and are headquarters in distribution center located in Long Island, New York and gross margins approximately the same as PetMeds. As we transform the PetMed's business, the acquisition of PetCareRx is the first catalyst that provides immediate growth as well as the ability to spend more in variable marketing as we work to sell more products to our customer base. One is -- and one of the interesting things about PetMeds versus an early-stage business is that we've got a huge database of customers that up until recently, we really didn't have a lot to talk to about. We have a huge opportunity in what we've got, and there's a lot of interesting net new data around what those customers want from a brand like what PetMeds. And then as I've mentioned, more speculative investments that we've made on pet telemedicine, I think, are going to be really interesting to see how, over the long term, the regulatory environment changes, but also how customers view PetMeds as not just a place to get your meds, but it's also a place to get all your other services that you'd expect to get."
