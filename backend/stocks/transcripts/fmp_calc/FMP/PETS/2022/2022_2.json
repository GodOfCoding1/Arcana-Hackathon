    "content": " For the second fiscal quarter ended on September 30, 2021 sales were $67.4 million compared to sales of $75.4 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 10.7%, but sales were only down 3.6% versus the quarter ended September 30, 2019 prior to the pandemic. So it's almost a resetting of the prescription cycle and many of the pet owners are going to the vet, buying there and then went online for the refill and we can sort of you know through our \u2013 through our data we know when it's time for a re-order and we'll go ahead and market for that reorder, subsequent reorder, and we expect to see that in the second half of this fiscal year is what I was referring to earlier in the call. We\u2019re not known for selling food, we\u2019re not known for selling dogs, we are known for providing expert advice and so for pet telehealth, while the market is really small, I see it's an opportunity to engage with our AutoShip customers in really unique ways, and then sell them additional services. I've already seen a lot of core areas that we can and have already begun to improve in this business and these include the following: Using more data insights acquired to retain customers, better segmentation of our customer base in order to drive more mass personalization of our offers and services; improved new customer acquisitions with a different allocation of variable marketing spend; expanded product and services that are already being demanded by our customers."
