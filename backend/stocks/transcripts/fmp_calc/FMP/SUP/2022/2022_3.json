    "content": " Our team delivered another quarter of solid results, including double-digit growth in value-added sales and adjusted EBITDA, along with substantial margin and content per wheel expansion; this while facing continued industry supply chain disruptions, depressed volumes and commodity cost increases. Value-added sales increased to $178 million for the quarter compared to $162 million in the prior year period due in large part to more wheels sold, but also customer recoveries of inflation offset in part by the weaker euro. Volume, price, and mix benefited value-added sales by $31 million in the quarter in large part because of the higher wheel sales compared to the third quarter of last year and recoveries of cost inflation. On slide 17, adjusted EBITDA increased to $36 million in the quarter compared to $30 million in the prior year period. Metal timing was a $6 million burn in the quarter, compared to a $7 million benefit in the prior year period. Slide 18, third quarter cash flow, cash flow provided by operating activities was $17 million, compared to negative cash flow provided by operating activities of $46 million in the prior year period. A cash payment for non-debt financing activities was $4 million, flat compared to the prior year. Having said all of that, we expect to sell 16 million to 17 million wheels in 2022 with net sales in the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range and value-added sales in the $740 million to $800 million range. I think just a question, when I look at the value-add sales per wheel, obviously, not adjusted for the numbers you present here, it looks like North America that has declined let's say 10% this year -- $46 to $42, whereas in Europe it's been going up quite a bit."
