    "content": " Further, our performance this quarter resulted in significant cash flow from operations, supporting a decrease in net debt to $477 million and enabled us to further invest in the business. Wheels sold in the first quarter were 4.1 million, down 9.5% from the prior year period. Value-added sales decreased to $189 million for the quarter compared to $207 million in the prior year period, primarily due to fewer wheels sold and a weaker euro, partially offset by favorable product mix. On Slide 16, adjusted EBITDA decreased to $49 million in the quarter compared to $55 million in the prior year period. Were not for this incremental $20 million investment in aluminum, net debt at quarter end would have been at the lowest level in Superior's recent history."
