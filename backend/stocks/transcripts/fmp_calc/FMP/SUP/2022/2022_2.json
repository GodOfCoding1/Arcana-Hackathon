    "content": " Last quarter, Q1, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin on $189 million of value-added sales was 26%. Value-added sales decreased to $186 million for the quarter compared to $196 million in the prior year period, primarily due to fewer wheels sold and a weaker euro. Volume, price and mix was negligible, the weaker euro burdened value-added sales by $11 million and aluminum cost pass-through to our customers was up $94 million, above 60% compared to the prior year period. Volume, price and mix was a $4 million burden on EBITDA, the weaker euro, a $1 million burden, metal timing was negligible and recovery of extraordinary cost inflation from our customers supplemented Q2 financial performance of $12 million. In a more normal business environment on Q2 value-added sales of $186 million, we might expect the margin to be in the range of 22% to 25%."
