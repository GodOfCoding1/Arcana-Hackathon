    "content": " You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing this play out with our recently announced 20-year LNG Sales and Purchase Agreement with Venture Global, with the commencement of downstream gas sales in Europe, and with the extension of our agreement with the Dubai Supply Authority. Our strategic goals at Excelerate include operating a profitable and growing fleet of FSRUs, growing our existing regasification business, expanding our downstream gas sales and our customer base in existing markets, while leveraging our global presence to enter new markets and managing a diversified portfolio of LNG supply. On a full year basis, adjusted EBITDAR for 2022 was $331 million, well above the high end of our guidance range due to the LNG cargo sale in Finland and over performance in Brazil during the fourth quarter. As compared to the prior year, our adjusted EBITDAR was up $40 million, an increase of 14%, primarily data having a full year of gas sales at the Bahia terminal in Brazil, which was partially offset by LNG marketing and supply activities in 2021 that did not reoccur in 2022 along with higher SG&A to support our transition to public company structure. So it will be a suspension for a couple of months and will return to earning revenue in late Q3 and if we look at what we would have earned in Germany versus what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll earn for 2023 with the suspension agreement and with the Argentina project, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be roughly $5 million to $6 million uplift to our EBITDA by having the seasonal service are."
