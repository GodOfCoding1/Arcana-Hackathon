    "content": " I'll focus my remarks today on 4 topics: Excelerate's second quarter financial results, the value of our downstream business model, the current state of the global LNG market and progress on our key projects. By going downstream after we open a new LNG market, we expect to capture a larger percentage of the economics along the value chain, whether it's through our E-FIT flexible terminal offering or actually selling molecules downstream of our terminals via onshore pipelines. The uncertainty around future flows of Russian pipeline gas and the increased European demand for regasified LNG, that's likely going to keep Dutch TTF gas pricing at an elevated level, heading into the winter season. As Steven mentioned, our adjusted EBITDAR was $75 million for the second quarter of 2022, up about $4 million versus the first quarter, driven primarily by the commencement of regasification services at the Bahia Blanca in May, and the FSRU expressed resuming operations under its long-term regasification charter in early April, along with higher gas sales volumes at the Bahia terminal in Brazil, partially offset by higher vessel operating costs. And the reason we've seen that is, historically, the FSRU business might have been around an 8x multiple, but we really see the advantages of going downstream, aggregating additional services, whether it's gas sales or anything else is including -- is helping us reach that 3x to 5x multiple."
