Your line is open. Your line is open. But I would want to add a couple of really important metrics, the first of which is the vast majority of our customers, close to 90%, do not currently own an EV, meaning most of our customers are new EV customers, which is really important from a mission point of view because it means the brand, the products we've created, it's helping -- we're helping to create new EV customers, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving that transition. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then to answer the second question you had on unit economics and what that looks like on a go-forward basis, I think one of the pieces that's most important to first understand is today, as you look at our cost of goods sold, the majority of that COGS per unit is really fixed costs within the business. Your line is open. Your line is open."
