We've made solid progress expanding our footprint within our G2K customers, but we've also worked hard to drive increased renewals and expansions within these larger customers as evidenced by our dollar-based net retention for customers with over 500 employees staying above 120% in the third quarter. As you may remember, we're happy to already count a number of international governments as our customers, which include one of our largest expansions this quarter, which became our first government entity having over $1 million in ARR. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. We actually want to make sure that we're fixing all the sales execution, continue to go upmarket and obviously, see what happens in the economy now with over $300 million in cash that put us in a really positive position. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
