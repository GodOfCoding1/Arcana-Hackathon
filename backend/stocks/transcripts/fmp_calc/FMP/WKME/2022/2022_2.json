    "content": " I'm thrilled with the progress we made over the last 2 years from selling single application use cases to now having 142 customers deploying WalkMe across far more applications all within ELA, now accounting for over $100 million of our ARR. ARR growth from customers with more than 500 employees continues to outpace the rest of our business, growing 31% year-over-year after accounting for the customer maintenance undergone in the fourth quarter of 2021. With that said, for the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $62.5 million to $63.5 million, representing growth of 24% to 25% year-over-year; non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $15.5 million to $16.5 million. We expect revenue in the range of $246 million to $249 million, representing growth of 27% to 29% year-over-year, non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $68 million to $65 million, reflecting a gradual improvement in operating leverage in the second half of 2022 as we continue to see returns from our investments. But I do believe that over the short term and, certainly, what we're thinking about increasingly is second half of this year and into 2023, there's not a lot of more -- there's not a lot more incremental investments we need to make in order to really drive the revenue growth that we see. So our goal is obviously to continue to adopt deployment, see more and more and more adopt customers and will time -- with time, it will get to more $1 million ARR customers."
