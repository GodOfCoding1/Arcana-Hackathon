    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, operating cash flow increased by $43 million to $232 million, compared to last year, mainly due to strong performance in working capital and the higher net income. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. So it's not a matter of, say high retroactivity or something that then increases the margin sequentially, it is the slightly higher volumes that we expect for the fourth quarter versus the third and that's particularly in Europe and Japan, it is a further improvement of the price position and then the seasonality on the higher engineering income, which is a typical pattern for our company, that are the main drivers for the fourth quarter. Please go ahead, your line is open. As I think we stating here in the Q3 report this quarter is important stepping stone towards our mid-term targets here and the framework around 12% that we have announced at least $85 million vehicle production level and that we have a net effect of raw material prices at 2021 years level, it's still valid, yes, absolutely. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
