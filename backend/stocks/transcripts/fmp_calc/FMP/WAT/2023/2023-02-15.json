    "content": " We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, and depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full-year 2023 revenue growth. Looking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a two-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. Your line is open. And if I were to just dig into the guide a little bit, when we say 5% to 6.5%, so the 5% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you just take the higher-end and then make it consistent, let's say, with the recurring revenues and the lower-end consistent with the instrument growth in the future, long-term averages for instrument growth are between 3% and 4%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. From the numbers perspective, on a full-year basis, it's double-digit growth for the Q, it came in at 6%, largely because of China. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
