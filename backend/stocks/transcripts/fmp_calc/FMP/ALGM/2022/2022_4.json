    "content": " Allegro delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2022, achieving several new records, including robust annual revenue growth of 30% resulting in the highest annual revenue in Allegro's history, as well as record profitability, including 410 basis points of non-GAAP gross margin expansion contributing to non-GAAP EPS growth of 70% for the full year. Revenue for the fiscal year '22 was a record $769 million, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Looking back on the year from a product perspective, magnetic sensors represented 65% of sales in fiscal '22, up 29% year-over-year, and all our magnetic sensor product lines achieved revenue highs. Moving on to markets, automotive represented 69% of revenue in fiscal '22, up 33% year-over-year, benefiting from strong content expansion, advanced driver assistance systems, comfort and convenience and vehicle electrification applications. As we enter a new fiscal year, we expect our alignment to secular growth trends and strong design win momentum will continue to serve as strong growth drivers, contributing to an increase in our full year revenue outlook to the high-teens. I believe our fiscal '23 car production model says that it's about a 9% year-over-year growth, and we expect our capital content growth to be 9% on top of that."
