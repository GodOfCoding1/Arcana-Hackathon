We continue to see strong growth in our xEV and ADAS businesses, which represented roughly 37% of our automotive revenue in the quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. I know you talked about design wins being up 100% as you look here, but just running how investors should think about revenue conversion, especially, these are pretty strong growth segments with xEV and ADAS and data center, etc. 23:15 Yeah, so when we start looking at the market in general, again, our business is really feel by the design wins that we have that are driving up our production win conversions, if you want to call it that, as well as the key sectors that were working in the cap rate, tailwinds xEV, ADAS as well as the broad industrial and data center. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. 38:50 Well, we did announce last quarter that we had signed several long-term agreements, we continue to wrap our industrial \u2013 our data center business, I think AD had a great stat on data center, quarter-over-quarter \u2013 year -over-year, okay\u2026\n 39:05 To get more than doubled.
