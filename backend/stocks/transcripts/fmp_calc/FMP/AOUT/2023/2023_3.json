    "content": " As a result, I believe we are well positioned for the time when retailers pivot from managing supply chain issues and inventory destocking initiatives to focusing on replenishing their inventories and preparing to deliver the innovative products consumers truly want. Net sales in Q3 were $50.9 million, a decrease of 27.4% compared to the prior year and an increase of 17.4% over the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020. Net sales in our ecommerce channel were $24.5 million a decrease of 30.8% from Q3 of last year, but a significant increase of almost 54% over the pre pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020. Net sales in our traditional channel, which consists of brick and mortar retailers, decreased 23.9% in the third quarter compared to last year, which we believe is due to retailers' continued efforts to reduce their overall inventories combined with lower consumer discretionary spending. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $27 million down roughly $400,000 from Q3 of last year mainly due to lower variable selling and distribution costs driven by the reduction in net sales."
