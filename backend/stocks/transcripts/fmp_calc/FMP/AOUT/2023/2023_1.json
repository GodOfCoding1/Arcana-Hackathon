    "content": " It's also important to note that strong net sales growth of over 70% in our traditional channel last year reflected that certain customers had accelerated their purchases to offset potential supply chain disruptions, creating a very tough comp for the current quarter. While we manage these elements, we will seek further opportunities to lower costs, while ensuring we remain well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities that can help us achieve our long-term plan to reach $400 million in net sales and EBITDAS margins in the mid to high-teens. Net sales in Q1 were $43.7 million, a decrease of 28.1% compared to the prior year, and an increase of 31.5% over pre-COVID Q1 of fiscal 2020. I think the biggest factor that we're weighing here is just what the consumer is going to do, and how our retailers, other inventories they may have that are outside of our categories, there might be some spring large type products, at least that I've heard that are out there that are taking up, they're open to buy and we'd like to see sell through some of those other types until they begin to open it back up. We do have very strong pipeline of new products that Andy mentioned, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strategically placing in the remainder part of this year and then likely some will move into next year because we want to get the most eyeballs on those new products when people aren't focused on older products that are being discounted at retail from other brands. And while we've pivoted on the launch timing for some of our new products, new product development is incredibly important for us in our brands as they grow, this last quarter being about 25% of our total net sales."
