    "content": " In that time, we've taken our revenue from $167 million in fiscal 2020 to over $247 million in fiscal 2022, representing net sales growth of nearly 48% over our pre-pandemic levels, and a two year CAGR of over 21%. We set out last year with a goal to grow our business by 8% to 10% over the ensuing four to five years, implying a business capable of generating $400 million in net sales annually with EBITDAs margins in the mid to high-teens. Net sales for the year were $247.5 million, a decrease of 10.5% compared to our record prior year and an increase of roughly 48% over fiscal 2020. On a quarterly basis, net sales in Q4 were $45.9 million, a decrease of approximately 29% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the decline in our shooting sports category."
