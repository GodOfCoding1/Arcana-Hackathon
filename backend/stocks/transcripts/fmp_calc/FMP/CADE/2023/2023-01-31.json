    "content": " We continue to benefit from a strong pipeline, which is reflected in net loan growth of $1.1 billion or 14% annualized for the fourth quarter and $3.5 billion or 13% for the full year. Focusing on the fourth quarter of 2022, the results include quarterly improvement in our net interest revenue due to loan growth and increasing margin and improvement in adjusted expenses due to year-end employee benefit adjustments. Moving on to expenses, which are highlighted on Slides 9 and 10, total adjusted non-interest expense was $279.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of $10.9 million compared to the third quarter. You may recall that last quarter we guided toward a $290 million base level of adjusted non-interest expenses, which was in-line with the fourth quarter results, factoring out the year-end adjustments made to employee benefits. Regarding non-interest expenses, we currently anticipate a low single-digit growth rate on an annualized basis, compared to the $290 million quarterly run rate guidance we previously provided for the fourth quarter of 2022. But assuming no surprises there, we actually -- we could have some modest improvement, where things kind of stabilize or soften but we are anticipating a better margin as we look to the end of the year, really related to all the repricing and the mix out of the securities book into the loan book and as we've talked about a number of times, the variable rate loans that's continued to reprice as long as we're at a higher rate environment. It's basically been flat the past three quarters from a dollar perspective and just wanted to hear some thoughts on provisioning going forward and just thinking about the black box of CECL, as well as the classified assets are really low, but they did tick up a little bit in the fourth quarter."
