    "content": " 05:46 As shown on Slide five, we reported net interest income of $312 million and a net interest margin of 2.92% for the first quarter, up from 2.90% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The yield of net loans, excluding accretion was 3.96% for the first quarter, down 10 basis points from the linked quarter, primarily due to the full quarterly impact of the legacy Cadence variable rate loan portfolio, C&I portfolio. As reflected on Slide eight, we reported net organic loan growth for the quarter of just over $300 million or 4.6% annualized, coming primarily in our C&I book. Our total non-performing loans declined $34.5 million or 22% during the quarter, bringing period-end NPLs to net loans and leases to 44 basis points, while non-performing assets also experienced a similar decline. 09:32 Non-interest revenue, which is highlighted on Slide 13, thus insurance having a nice quarter and reporting total commission revenue, up $36 million for the quarter or 17% for the first quarter of last year. The only other thing I would really add to that is, we've incurred about $55 million-ish or so pre-tax, when you look at the fourth quarter, first quarter and then actually looking back at the third quarter of '21, some of that, that was a little bit early. The future risk that's out there is the dark cloud that you're looking at history, four quarters in a row of net recoveries would tell you that credit is in really fine shape."
