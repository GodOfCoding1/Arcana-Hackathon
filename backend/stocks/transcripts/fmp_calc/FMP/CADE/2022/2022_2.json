    "content": " Adjusted noninterest expense declined by just over $9 million or 3% compared to the second quarter, contributing to a decline of over 300 basis points in the adjusted efficiency ratio to 60.5%. As shown on Slide 4, we reported net interest income of $325 million for the second quarter, an increase of over 4% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Finally, the linked quarter decline in other noninterest revenue included a $1.2 million purchase accounting adjustment, reducing second quarter revenue as we finalize the day one fair value of unfunded commitments acquired as part of the legacy Cadence merger. I think you give that to us last quarter, and I couldn't find it this time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n I can give you 27%, I think is the number\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n 24% is the book or floating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Floating within 30 days\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Floating for 30 days\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n While she is pulling that up, I think it's 40-something percent variable on top of that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n But the floating within 30 days, it's about 4$6.9 million."
