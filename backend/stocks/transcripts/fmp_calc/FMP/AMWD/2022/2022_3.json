    "content": " After realizing approximately a $30 million plus of pricing impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we've announced or finalized additional actions that will benefit our business beginning in April. At our current sales level, we expect the impact of our confirmed quarterly pricing actions to increase by additional $25 million versus the third fiscal quarter to over $55 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net sales were $459.7 million, inclusive of approximately $30 million of price, representing an increase of 6.4% over the same period last year. Net loss for the quarter was $49.3 million or a negative $2.97 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 versus $18.4 million or $1.08 per diluted share last year. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $67.7 million primarily due to a onetime pre-tax charge related to our pension termination of $69.5 million and the challenges we encountered with our labor force, supply chain and two days of weather impacts across our locations. Adjusted EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter 2022 was $30.6 million or 6.6% of net sales compared to $55.7 million or 12.9% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The company's gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 11.3% of net sales versus 17.9% recorded in the same quarter of last year. Please go ahead with your question.
