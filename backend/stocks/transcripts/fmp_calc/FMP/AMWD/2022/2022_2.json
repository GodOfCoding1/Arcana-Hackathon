    "content": " Please go ahead, sir. After realizing approximately $3 million of impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for pricing, that impact grew approximately $14 million in the second quarter. At our current sales levels, we expect the impact of our confirmed pricing actions to increase to over $35 million in the third fiscal quarter and over $50 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net sales were $453 million inclusive of $14 million of price, representing an increase of 1% over the same period last year. Looking at completions during our second fiscal quarter, we saw a 3.4% increase year over year, which further supports timing impacts the market is experiencing and our continued growth in the new construction channel. Total operating expenses were 10.2% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with 11.5% of net sales for the same period of fiscal 2021. Selling and marketing expenses were 4.8% of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with 4.8% of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2021. On your high-single digit sales growth outlook for the year, correct me if I'm wrong, is that up from the guide last quarter, I think it was mid-to-high single-digits and if so what's the incremental differences at just the additional pricing you're putting through. So the two points we wanted to highlight is incremental pricing plus our total pricing that will be realized in the quarters, over $35 million in Q3, over $50 million in Q4 and as a result, we do expect sequential margin improvement off of what we just delivered in Q2 over the next few quarters. Please go ahead, sir."
