    "content": " I mentioned last quarter that our incoming order rates across both the new construction and remodel businesses exceeded shipments for the quarter and that our teams are increasing production levels, which would drive incremental sales in our first fiscal quarter as we improve backlog levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the first fiscal quarter was $32.1 million or 7.3% of net sales, compared to $56.4 million or 14.5% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The ratio to net sales increased 10 basis points resulting from the increased display, launch and healthcare costs, partially offset by the leverage created from the higher sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2022."
