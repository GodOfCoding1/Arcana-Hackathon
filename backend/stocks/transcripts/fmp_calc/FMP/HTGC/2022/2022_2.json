    "content": " Similar to what we saw in Q1, early payoffs during Q2 remained low, which resulted in strong sequential net debt investment portfolio growth of over $169 million during the second quarter and a record $360 million for the first half of 2022. To support the record net debt portfolio growth that the investment team delivered in the first half of 2022 and with support of our financial institutional partners, Hercules was able to leverage our recognized credit-first culture and strong investment-grade ratings to raise over $530 million of equity, debt financing and credit facility capacity in Q2."
