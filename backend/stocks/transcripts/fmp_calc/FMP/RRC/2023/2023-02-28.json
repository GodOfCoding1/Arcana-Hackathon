    "content": " Significant improvements in fourth quarter free cash flow were driven by a combination of lower expenses and a 5% improvement in hedged realized prices per unit of production versus the prior year period, with realized price per unit reaching $4.33 per mcfe in the fourth quarter. Turning from 2022 accomplishment to where the company is headed in 2023, given the strong foundation provided by high quality assets paired with low financial leverage, we expect Range\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic focus will remain consistent going forward: Generate free cash flow, reduce debt, prudently return capital and reinvest in the business. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. NGL piece, Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touched on it a number of times in prior calls, but you know as you start to look at the number of exports, barrels that are leaving the docks from a propane perspective as an example in LPG, we're still seeing some record level exports occur today, which is really encouraging, and of course we're all watching the reopening of China take place, and we know that that will translate into further supporting of reducing stock levels and continuing to support a back half of the year, constructive outlook for further NGL price improvements. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think if you look back over the last couple of years, as you point out, we continue to make a progression to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we just touched on in our prepared remarks, we drilled some of our top 15 longest laterals in the balance of the fourth quarter, and we have more wells like that planned for the 2023 program."
