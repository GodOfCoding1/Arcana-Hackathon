    "content": " Looking at the quarter, Range successfully delivered on our third quarter development plans and capital spending remains on track with the high end of our original full year guidance of $460 million to $480 million for completing the 2022 operational plan. Range's natural gas liquids production also had strong pricing of over $35 barrel, up 4% from last year's third quarter. Range's pre-hedge NGL price for Q3 was $35.30 per barrel, an increase of $1.25 versus the prior year's quarter and approximately $1.53 below the Mont Belvieu weighted equivalent. Given year-to-date net debt reduction better than $500 million and the pace of further planned debt reduction, driven by strong forecasted cash flow as well as what we believe is a significant disconnect in Range's asset value compared to stock price, Range's Board has approved a $1 billion increase in the share repurchase plan, bringing total available repurchase capacity to nearly $1.2 billion. Range's diversified portfolio of transportation capacity and customer contracts, largely mitigates in-basin pricing risk, given that approximately 80% of natural gas production is delivered to out-of-basin markets on firm transportation. I would say, just given Range's historical development in that area, it gave us a high end others we've seen a high degree of confidence in the type curves that we put together in that area, much like in Southwest PA. And that's another thing that's really encouraging for us is as we look at our dry gas inventory in the southwest part of the state, those economics clearly compete across the program for us now."
