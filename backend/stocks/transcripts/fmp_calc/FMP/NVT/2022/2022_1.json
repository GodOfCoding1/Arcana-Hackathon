    "content": " First quarter segment income was $110 million, up 13%, while return on sales of 15.9% was down 180 basis points, both better than expected. Starting with Enclosures, sales of $359 million increased 30% and 23% organically, with another quarter of strong contribution from both volume and price. And then, if you look at that margin sequentially from a ROS performance standpoint, we would expect Enclosures ROS to improve really largely on a better price/cost position, as well as just better leverage on some of these investments on growth and capacity that we're making. From a Thermal Management perspective, we still expect great ROS expansion in the quarter, just not to the magnitude of Q1, and that's largely because that's when we begin to lap that industrial MRO recovery of a year ago that really began in earnest there in Q2."
