Under the project, Vantage Towers Greece, a subsidiary of Vantage Towers Group, one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading tower companies, will explore the applicability of advance biomethanol-powered fuel cell systems as backup and primary power sources for its telecom towers, following the successful completion of the project with Greece, Advent and Vantage Towers would consider wider deployment. In January this year, Advent announced a collaboration with Alfa Laval, a global provider of heat transfer, separation fuel handling products on a project to explore application of Advent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s methanol-powered high temperature PEM fuel cells in the marine industry, funded by the Danish Energy Technology development and demonstration program, the project with a joint effort between, Advent Alfa Laval and a group of shipowners. Aiming to meet the ever-growing power requirements of the marine industry, Advent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next-generation fuel cells are expected to demonstrate a significant increase in lifetime efficiency and electrical output."
