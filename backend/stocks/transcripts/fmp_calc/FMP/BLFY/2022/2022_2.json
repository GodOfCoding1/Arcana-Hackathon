    "content": " Organic originations totaled $147 million, the largest quarterly originations achieved in Blue Foundry's history. In regards to expenses, we continue to closely manage our operating expenses, which resulted in a sequential decline of 1.9% or $259,000 to $13.1 million, excluding the impact of the provision for commitments and letters of credit, variable expenses within professional services and advertising drove the decline. Our commercial real estate portfolios experienced strong growth in the quarter, driven by originations of $140 million. During the quarter, the bank also purchased $28 million of high-quality residential loans in our principal market, which were originated to Fannie Mae standards, compared to $46 million of purchases in the previous quarter. During the quarter, the portfolio declined by $23.4 million due to maturities, calls, scheduled pay downs and mark-to-market adjustments. Your multifamily book sitting at $579 million, huge growth in the quarter, 48% annualized. I think as we look forward, we're looking at staying within that $13.5 million quarterly run rate from an expense spend perspective."
