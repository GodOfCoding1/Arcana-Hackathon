    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-04-27 17:16:03",
    "content": " We also worked diligently to reduce our core operating expenses, which decreased by over $1 million in the quarter. Excluding PPP, quarterly gross loan growth came in at a net of $64.1 million with strong performance within our commercial lending teams. Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income decreased $397,000 or 3% to $11.9 million. Interest income decreased by $641,000 or 5% during the quarter, which was driven primarily by $600,000 lower realization of PPP income in the quarter, coupled with the timing of loan and investment portfolio growth being later in the quarter. Interest expense continued to decrease from last quarter by 13% or $244,000 to $1.7 million. Quarter-over-quarter, gross loans, excluding PPP, increased by $64.1 million or 5%, primarily due to strong origination performance across our CRE portfolios, coupled with the continuation of the residential loan purchase program. During the quarter, the bank purchased approximately $45 million of high-quality residential loans originated to Fannie Mae standards and to borrowers in our principal market. And so on to net interest income, I just wanted to verify the amount of PPP gains you realized this quarter was $265 million."
