    "content": " Our lending team produced $594 million of loans, which drove 20% net loan growth during the year. While our allowance to total loans decreased 4 basis points to 87 basis points, our allowance to non-accrual loans increased to 173% from 162% the prior quarter due to a reduction in non-accrual loans. Gross loans grew by $51 million or 3.4% sequentially, driven by originations of $68 million, primarily in the non-residential and multifamily segments. During the quarter, the bank also purchased $18 million of high-quality residential loans in our principal market, which were originated to Fannie Mae standards. So, obviously, thinking about that, adding that back, we're already over $13 million in a quarterly run rate for noninterest expenses. Relative to the overall range of what we're looking at from an expense on -- for an operating expense, we're looking at the mid to high $13 million range, as we continue to look at avenues to optimize our business model and being laser-focused on managing those operating expenses."
