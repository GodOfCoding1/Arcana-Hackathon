    "content": " Continued foreign exchange headwinds and slightly higher spend on R&D investment across the portfolio largely offset our top line outperformance, resulting in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, achieving the low end of our guidance range, representing 6.3% growth versus 2021. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be approximately 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 100 basis points higher than our previous expectations. Excluding a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021, we now expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be approximately 9% versus 2021, reflecting our strong Q4 performance and confidence in continued consistent procedural growth."
