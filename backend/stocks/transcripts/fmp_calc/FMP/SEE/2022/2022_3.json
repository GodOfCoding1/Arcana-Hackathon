    "content": " Liquibox's expected 2022 full year revenue is $362 million and adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, representing a margin of 23.5%. On Slide 14, I'd like to highlight a strong improvement in profitability with Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, increased $22 million or 8% compared to last year, with margins of 20.9%, up 170 basis points. In Q3, Food net sales of $830 million were up 9% on an organic basis, which consisted of 13% price realization to help offset inflationary pressures across all cost categories and volume declines of 4%. Food adjusted EBITDA of $185 million in Q3 increased 14% in constant dollars compared to last year, with margins at 22.3%, up 110 basis points. Despite end market weakness in the quarter, Protective adjusted EBITDA of $109 million increased 12% in constant dollars in Q3, with margins at 19.2%, up 230 basis points. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, down from $1.22 billion to $1.25 million, and assumes adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 21%, in line with prior estimates despite the top line pressures. So if you look at where this fits into our model, we're acquiring a business that's -- right now into our portfolio that last year was 3%. So with that said, we're putting a 23% operating profit business of $362 million into that pro forma, and that's what you see. So if we look at this, what we're excited about this business versus other technologies, if you look at that fitment and, again, doing well over 1 billion fitments, there's -- just like CRYOVAC, the CRYOVAC secret sauce is how do you put these layered materials together to protect the product like no other. Also, what's interesting on Asia Pacific, where we did have a penetration and actually growth different, is we are seeing penetration as the world because of, as Chris highlighted, the China condition, we're seeing the markets outside of China growing and we're there locally with them, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, these are small numbers and our second largest region, Australia, and we're seeing that -- those as bright spots as we drive through on the Protective side. It looks like what would it imply is maybe some contribution from Liquibox, maybe 3 quarters next year, plus maybe $15 million of synergies, and then in 2024, you'd get the rest $15 million synergies and set maybe 7% to 9% EBITDA growth, which would put you at $1.4 billion."
