    "content": " So if you unpacked equipment, if we just look at slide seven, where we talked about automation, we spent a lot of time on our investment, it was actually misses in the quarter on the sales side, where we do have a huge backlog on equipment and what we're still struggling with supply constraints to get some of that through. Food, again, if you put the supply constraints aside, we thought we would have been more on the flat side for food volumes for the quarter and the Protective piece of it, given the tougher comps quarter over quarter, given the vaccine distribution last year, et cetera, we're feeling that, but we expect flattish for the second half of the year for Protective. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. So the assumption on the Food side for the second half of the year is that low single-digit growth, both for third and the fourth quarter, which then plays itself out to roughly approximately a 2% growth in Food volumes for the full year. Your line is open, please go ahead. And what we're seeing is given the price realization, more of a $600 million plus number is what we're anticipating to get on the price side of the equation, we just talked about volume, volume to be more flattish versus a positive 1%, I think, maybe the 2% growth that we expected last time."
