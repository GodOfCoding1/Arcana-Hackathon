Food adjusted EBITDA of $202 million in Q4 increased 2% in constant dollars compared to last year with margins at 23.1%, down 20 basis points. Protective adjusted EBITDA of $102 million was down 15% in constant dollars in Q4 with margins at 19.2%, only down 10 basis points despite the end-market weakness and customer destocking activity. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80 assuming depreciation and amortization at the midpoint of approximately $275 million, an adjusted effective tax rate between 26% to 27%, net interest expense of approximately $275 million at the midpoint and approximately 146 million average shares outstanding. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted before, in our SEE operating model on Slide 7, our digital transformation will be driving 1% growth over time by broadening our sales reach, making it easier to do business with us and delivering 30 basis point operational efficiency gains.

Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
