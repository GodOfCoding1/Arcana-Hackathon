    "content": " Fiscal 2023 is off to a strong start, including record first quarter net sales and volume growth across multiple distribution channels and our consumer branded business. Starting with the income statement, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 11.6% to $252.6 million compared to net sales of $226.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The overall decrease in sales volume for the consumer distribution channel was also partially offset by an 8.2% sales volume increase for our branded products, which include Fisher recipe nuts, Fisher snack nuts, Orchard Valley Harvest and Southern Style Nuts. Total operating expenses for the current first quarter increased $3.8 million in the quarterly comparison due to a nonrecurring gain of approximately $2.3 million from the sale of the Garysburg, North Carolina facility, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Total operating expenses for the first -- for the current first quarter increased to 11.2% of net sales from 10.8% for last year's first quarter due to the reasons I noted above, which was primarily offset by a higher net sales base. Our produce nut brand, Orchard Valley Harvest, declined 9% in dollars and 10% in pound sales, driven by distribution declines in mass, offsetting strong performance in the grocery channel."
