    "content": " The volume increase in the consumer channel was primarily driven by a 9.9% increase in private brand sales volume, from increases in trail and snack mixes resulting from new distribution at an existing customer and increased consumer demand for lower priced products such as peanuts in response to the current economic environment. Looking at sales volume for our branded products in the consumer channel, Fisher recipe nuts volume increased 17.3%, in large part due to the later Easter Holiday this year and increase in e-commerce volume due to improved online content and enhanced promotional support. Sales volume increased 20.5% in the commercial ingredients distribution channel, primarily due to a 30.4% increase in sales volume to food service customers related to the continued recovery in the restaurant industry from the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, and new distribution at existing customers. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of the current year increased $9.4 million, while our gross profit margin decreased to 21.8% of net sales, for a current fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Total operating expenses in the quarterly comparison increased $2.4 million, while total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 190 basis points to 12.3%.
