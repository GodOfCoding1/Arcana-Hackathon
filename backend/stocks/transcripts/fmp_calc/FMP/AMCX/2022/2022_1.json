    "content": "  AMC Networks\u2019 first quarter marked a solid start to 2022, highlighted by total company revenue growth, strong gains in streaming revenue and subscribers and continued momentum for our strong content slate across our portfolio of super-fan brands. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve achieved a Q1 streaming subscriber target we laid out on our last call, adding more than 430,000 new subscribers in the first quarter in aggregate across our portfolio, and ending the quarter with 9.5 million total paying subscribers. And with our content cost advantages, our continued ability to super serve audiences and fans with deep content offerings and our clear focus on profitability by virtue of our unique strategy, we feel better than ever about reiterating our previously communicated target of achieving between 20 million and 25 million streaming subscribers in 2025. In fact, since this time last year across all of our streaming services, we\u2019ve added over 1,500 hours of new content and we ended the quarter with over 12,000 hours of content for our subscribers to enjoy. Our year is off to a strong start with the continued growth of our streaming subscribers across all services and with growing monthly streaming subscribers and revenue, with our strongest programming slate still to come in the remainder of the year. We are just beginning to see the benefits of our robust 2022 content slate materialize, partly in the form of beneficial subscriber retention performance as we have experienced an improvement in churn rates across our entire portfolio of streaming services as compared to the prior year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
