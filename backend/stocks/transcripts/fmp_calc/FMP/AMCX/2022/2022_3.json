    "content": " We developed and launched a carefully orchestrated marketing campaign that significantly broke through to new and existing fans, utilizing our multiple distribution platforms and our awareness and performance marketing capabilities as a powerful megaphone to launch the series and our new Anne Rice Immortal Universe franchise, our campaign kicked off earlier this year at San Diego Comic-Con, and in September, our new AMC+ brand campaign with our new Above and Beyond tagline, fueled strong awareness leading into the series launch which was in tandem with the premiere of the final 8 episodes of the Walking Dead flagship series, providing us with a huge built-in audience. As the distribution and streaming landscape continues to evolve, our digital platforms are evolving and expanding creating new avenues for monetizing our high-quality content and tying to our third goal, maximizing the value of new digital opportunities and taking full advantage of the strength of our linear television business as we manage winning economics and profitability. Consolidated revenue decreased by 16% to $682 million, largely driven by the timing and availability of content licensing deliveries, lower affiliate and advertising revenues and unfavorable foreign currency translation, partly offset by strong streaming revenue growth of 41%. Consolidated adjusted operating income decreased by 14% to $194 million, with a margin of 28%, reflecting lower revenue, partly offset by lower operating expenses and SG&A, driven by disciplined cost management and the timing of our content and marketing investments. Domestic operations advertising revenue decreased 10% to $180 million, primarily due to lower linear viewership, softer scatter and direct response markets, and fewer original hours, partly offset by digital and advanced advertising revenue growth."
