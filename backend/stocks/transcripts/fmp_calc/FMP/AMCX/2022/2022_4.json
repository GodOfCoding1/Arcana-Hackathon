    "content": " While the majority of the restructuring and other charges are non cash, we accrued for the cash portion in the fourth quarter, including $73 million of strategic programming write offs and $41 million of severance and employee related costs, which will contribute to a cash outflow of approximately $115 million in 2023. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Certainly not $500, that they -- so, if there needs to be an adjustment what AMC is doing is essentially maintaining its revenue streams, make stabilizing itself, not doing that kind of investment that values streaming customers of $500, but rather laying back, watching the marketplace, working with retailers like MVPDs, and waiting for our opportunity to take our great content and put it into a vehicle that truly monetizes it. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
