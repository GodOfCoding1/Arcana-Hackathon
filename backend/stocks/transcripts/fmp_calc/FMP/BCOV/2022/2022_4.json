    "content": "   During today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements concerning our financial guidance for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 and the full year 2023, expected profitability and positive free cash flow, our position to execute on our go-to-market and growth strategy, our ability to expand our leadership position, our ability to maintain and upsell existing customers as well as our ability to acquire new customers. Yeah well I think as you heard us say or heard me say that we saw more six and seven figure activity than we have in a long time and certainly saw the average deal size go up on a multiple basis in Q4, and our expectation is that we'll continue, it's hard to draw trends from like a quarter or so, but we do feel like given where the pipeline is coming in and what we're seeing in the quarter and what we see projected out through the year and the types of deals we're looking at, that we feel confident that that's the type of thing we're going to be targeting throughout 2023 and beyond."
