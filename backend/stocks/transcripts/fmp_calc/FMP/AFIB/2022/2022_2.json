    "content": " David will cover first quarter 2022 results in key clinical and pipeline developments, as well as provide further details on recent strategic transactions, including the refinancing of our debt and the definitive agreement to sell our left heart business portfolio to Medtronic. The strong performance and disposable revenue was primarily led by an increase in procedure volumes, both in the US and internationally, orders associated with new installs as well as continued adoption of the AcQBlate therapy catheter and growth in left heart access. So earlier, earlier I was mentioning, there's the expected 30% to 35% increase in disposable revenue for 2022. so the 30% to 35% that we had given in March that was disposal revenue, and that did not include the expected sale of our left heart access portfolio or any weakening, excuse me, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which is, which does represent a pretty decent headwind to our U.S. business."
