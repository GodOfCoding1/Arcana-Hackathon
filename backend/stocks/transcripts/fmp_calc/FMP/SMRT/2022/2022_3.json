    "content": " We delivered $47.5 million in total revenue and deployed over 53,000 units with both results faring better than the guidance we communicated last quarter. All of our primary SaaS measures, ARR of $31.8 million and ARPU of $3.50 continue to grow, and SaaS revenue is close to 4x what it was last year, demonstrating our success in increasing price and cross-selling additional products. In the third quarter of 2022, we delivered another record quarter with total revenue of $47.5 million, up 12% from $42.4 million in the second quarter. Drilling further into Hosted Services, SaaS revenue in the quarter increased 4% to approximately $8 million from $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA has now improved by more than $5 million compared to the first quarter of 2022, and we believe this general trajectory is sustainable, providing a sight line into a path to quarterly profitability in 2023. We ended the quarter with approximately $128.2 million of deferred revenue on our balance sheet, up 2% from $125.4 million in the previous quarter, and we expect to recognize 49% of the deferred revenue within the next 12 months. So I'm just curious if there's any way you can help frame for us, without some of the supply constraints that you've been facing, if there's a way to think about either for the quarter or for the year, how many units you could have deployed, i.e., what kind of -- how much supply is actually holding you guys back?"
