    "content": " But you know this technology is new and  products you know the  is in China now gene editing already created proof of the procedure - he is already this way it seems like, more like U.S. you know, if you are internally just genes, not putting outside the genes well basically trait as a normal corn. So that gave us you know, big advantage and maybe the - a pooling process will be much faster And even for example, sometimes even U.S. customers or even do know this really breeding from gene editing, or from trait operating, but basically no much difference, but gene editing is much, much, much faster, much more efficient, and much it's very - well very exciting about this technology. As you know last 10 or 20 years Origin is building the focus on the technology on the seed business that we are really put a lot of effort on GMO corn, which is you know, recent get just most profit and but we didn't touch other things. So this was really a new growing area for us as you know, as you mentioned you know corn seed market in China right now is around at RMB300 million and if you cover for the GMO maybe double like RMB600 million to RMB1 billion that's the total world of corn seed. So we have lots of contracts, you know, to request some kind of collaboration with us I think is much - very exciting I think for this area that - we can see next I mean, not only see them in next coming few years, we'll be you know, we just can't meet the demand for the request for these kind of products. Yes, I think so I would likely you know, due to the pandemic issues in a way in the last three years, basically you can't travel freely sometimes with so much disruption for you know, really daily work."
