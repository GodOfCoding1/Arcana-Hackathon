    "content": " During the quarter, we continue to navigate industry-wide challenges, including inflation, where the latest food-at-home reading was 10.8% higher than last year, record high fuel costs, low but improving fill rates and challenging labor shortages, all of which continue to impact our business and our customers. We are pleased that our performance reflects continued sales gains from both existing and new customers and allows us to increase our full-year sales and earnings guidance under what we believe to be a more transparent and meaningful definition of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which John will address shortly. On this revised basis, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $196 million, a 5.9% increase compared to the $185 million in last year's third quarter, when computed on the same basis. Including several smaller items and the tax impact of the adjustments, adjusted EPS on the revised basis also totaled $1.10 for the third quarter compared to $1 and last year's third quarter on a revised basis, an increase of 10%. As for the longer term fiscal 2024 targets we provided at last June's Investor Day, we are affirming the average annual growth rates provided for net sales of 3% to 5%, adjusted EBITDA of 6% to 10% and adjusted EPS of 12% to 18%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I hope you've heard and take away from today's call that UNFI is growing and performing within a changing environment by steadfastly focusing on our four operating principles that underpin our execution of the fuel the future strategy, bringing value to our customers, improving the way we partner with suppliers, creating unmatched career opportunities for our associates and supporting our communities and the planet."
