    "content": " To more effectively bring together suppliers and customers, we're developing unique new programs that provide better and deeper insights into UNFI's diverse retailer base so that UNFI, our suppliers and our customers can collectively work together in partnership to create more and more value together. Finally, we're encouraged by the performance of our retail stores, as sales were down only slightly against a very strong comparison in fiscal 2021's first quarter when sales increased by more than 15%. First quarter operating expense rate declined 20 basis points compared to last year, driven by the favorable leverage from higher sales and lower year-over-year costs when comparing last year's cost related to the consolidation in the Pacific Northwest, against this year's start-up costs for our DC, supporting the New York metro area."
