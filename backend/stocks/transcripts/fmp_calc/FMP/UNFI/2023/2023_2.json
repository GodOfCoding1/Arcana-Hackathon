    "content": " While we expected inflation to decline and the supply chain to continue to normalize, we did not fully appreciate the benefit to last year's gross profit from buying inventory in advance of supplier price increases in a sequentially rising inflationary environment. Retail sales grew 2.6% compared to last year's second quarter, a sequential improvement from the 1.8% growth rate in Q1 driven by higher average unit retail pricing. Our retail sales comparison was especially challenging this quarter as we cycled last year's onset of Omnicron, as well as several weather events in the Minneapolis, St. Paul area, both of which added business in last year's second quarter. And as we stated on our last call, we expect to see productivity gains from a more experienced workforce in the back half of the fiscal year, which should enhance efficiency and continue to favorably impact our customers' experience. Within our retail segment, adjusted EBITDA was down about $4 million compared to last year's second quarter. Adjusting for these items and the tax impact, our adjusted EPS totaled $0.78 compared to $1.36 in last year's second quarter. We also now expect our year end adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be roughly flat compared to the end of fiscal 2022, driven by net debt reduction, including the benefits from the AR monetization program, offset by lower full year adjusted EBITDA. As we look ahead, obviously, we don't claim to be expert accountants, but what we can see and is driving our performance is that, there are significantly less price increases taking place and that should lead to lower inflation, lower inflation should result in units bouncing back and exactly how and when that happens is anybody's guess, but we would expect inflation to moderate as the year goes on and units hopefully to improve slightly. So for the second quarter this year, our overall inflation impact to the overall company was just below 11%, which is compared to Q2 last year was little over 11%. And while margins started to pick up in P6 due to forward buying, the operating expense side of our business grew and we had lots sales and no EBITDA growth in the second quarter last year."
