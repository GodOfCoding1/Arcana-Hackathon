    "content": " As Jeff mentioned, we had a strong start to the year with revenue of $1.225 billion, delivering 2% constant currency growth driven by a 2% increase from price, primarily in pet health. On the farm animal side, the business grew 1% at constant currency, driven by improving end market prices and innovation and poultry and robust growth for Aqua, which included some phasing from Q2, partially offset by the continued and expected pressure in the China swine market in the quarter. Additionally, after growing mid-single digits on a pro forma basis in 2021, our global cattle business declined 3% in constant currency in the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by generic competition impacting price on several key brands. Adjusted EBITDA was $339 million in the quarter or 27.7% of revenue, representing a modest expansion of 10 basis points, despite the headwinds of inflation fell on both the gross profit and operating expense lines and the revenue headwind from foreign exchange rates. Our initial guidance in February expected a 1 percentage point of growth at constant currency, with portfolio and innovation growth of 3%, offset by a 2 percentage point decline as a result of known headwinds, primarily from the step-down in contract manufacturing, known competitive and generic pressures and the weakness in the China swine business year-over-year. We are committed to full year guidance in constant currency as we noted in our comments, 2% to 3% sales and then the EBITDA EPS, we're also committed to the 4.75% leverage and $120 million to $160 million of innovations.
