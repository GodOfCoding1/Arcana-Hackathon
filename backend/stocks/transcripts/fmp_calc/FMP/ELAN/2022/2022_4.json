    "content": " In 2022, Elanco delivered just over $4.4 billion in revenue, a 3% decline in constant currency with Farm Animal flat and Pet Health declining 5%. We delivered approximately $140 million in incremental synergies, bringing the cumulative total to $363 million through 2022 and exceeding previous expectations as we efficiently executed our fourth quarter 2021 restructuring and accelerated expected savings from 2023 into 2022. While we are still finalizing our operating cash flow results for 2022, we expect full year to be between $450 million to $460 million for the year, and between $10 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. After our reprioritization of the R&D portfolio and reduction in 2022, we expect our R&D investments to be approximately $80 million per quarter were generally flat year-over-year as Ellen and her team continue to drive our innovation forward. The reduction in adjusted EBITDA translates to $0.03 to $0.15 of the year-over-year decline, with increased interest expense from our floating rate debt and the expectation of higher tax rate in 2023, primarily driving an additional $0.21 to $0.24 of decline. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. What I understand from this is you're likely to get around $90 million of pricing benefit this year, assuming 2% and another $100 million to $110 million of innovation driven incremental revenue. Your line is open."
