    "content": " Comments we may make that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including among others, such factors as risks and uncertainties related to future sales and revenue, uncertainties related to dividend payments and future stock repurchases, and risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the risk factors listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2021 as updated in our just filed 10-Q. As Dan said, total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 increased 56% to $6.82 million compared to $4.38 million last year, due to a 59% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 13% decrease in contract R&D revenue."
