    "content": " Total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 increased 56% to $7.15 million compared to $4.59 million last year, due to a 60% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 14% decrease in contract R&D revenue. The impact of the pandemic on elective medical devices also appears to be recovering based on the orders forecast and what we\u2019ve been hearing, we currently expect a strong year-over-year growth this quarter, the quarter ending September 30, 2021. We are working to try to reach some of those smaller companies that you mentioned, but also some of the companies that make the sub-assemblies, what are called Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers in the automotive industry that might be providing battery management systems or modules for companies that aren\u2019t going to design that themselves."
