    "content": " For our PEO business, our average worksite employees were up 9% over the prior year quarter and is the culmination of the controllable growth as well as our clients' hiring. Our staffing business increased 18% over the prior year quarter, and we continue to experience favorable year-over-year growth trends. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, our confidence in raising guidance starts with our higher than expected Q2 starting point for our installed base of clients and WSE stack, plus optimism of our revamped and disciplined sales and service teams executing on controllable growth and a slower increase in client hiring toward the backend of the year. As Gary noted, our increase in PEO gross billings was driven by stronger than expected growth from net new clients in the quarter, stronger than expected hiring within our client base and higher average billings per WSE. PEO gross billings growth by region versus the prior year first quarter, were as follows: Mountain States grew 38%, East Coast grew 25%. Looking holistically at the business, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through our strategy of generating consistent profitable growth in earnings leverage, derisking our workers' compensation program, investing in growth initiatives, including IT, sales strategies and expanding into new markets and returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and stock buyback. But Q1, our client hiring exceeded our expectations, and then we're just kind of looking at the back half of the year saying can we get that WSE growth in our installed base in this tight labor market."
