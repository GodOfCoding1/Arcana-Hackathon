    "content": " For our PEO business, our average worksite employees were up 9% over the prior year quarter, which is the culmination of controllable growth as well as our clients hiring. Our staffing business increased 21% over the prior year quarter, and we continue to experience favorable year-over-year growth trends. As Gary noted, our increase in PEO gross billings was driven by stronger-than-expected growth from net new clients in the quarter, continued stronger-than-expected hiring within our client base and higher average billing per worksite employee. PEO gross billings growth by region versus the prior year second quarter were as follows: Mountain States grew 34%, East Coast grew 22%, the Pacific Northwest grew 10%, Southern California grew 11% and Northern California grew by 10%."
