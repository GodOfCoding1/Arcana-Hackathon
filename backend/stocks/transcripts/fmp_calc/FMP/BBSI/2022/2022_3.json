    "content": " Our average worksite employees were up 8% over the prior year quarter, which is the culmination of controllable growth as well as our clients' hiring. PEO gross billings increased 13% over the prior year quarter to $1.9 billion, while staffing revenues increased 1% over prior year to $29 million. As Gary noted, our increase in PEO gross billings was driven by stronger-than-expected growth from net new clients in the quarter, continued stronger-than-expected hiring within our client base, and higher average billing per worksite employee. We learned some valuable things along the way so that when we try to take this thing to scale next year and offer in California and then offer it to new clients, we're going to have a much better conversion rate because we've learned some things this year. And then we're going to have a strategy similar to what we did this year as far as I call it making new friends going out and advertising and attracting new referral partners, specifically in the benefit space and explaining the BBSI product."
