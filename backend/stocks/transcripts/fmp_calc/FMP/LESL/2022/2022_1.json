    "content": " Total reported sales increased to $184.8 million, or 27.5% compared to first quarter of fiscal 2021. Excluding these non-recurring items in fiscal 2021, the year-over-year SG&A increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven primarily by our sales increase, investments to support our growth and expenses associated with acquisitions completed after the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As a result of the tireless efforts of our team, we ended the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with inventory of $245 million, up 40% compared to $175 million at the end of the prior year quarter. In fiscal 2021, the first half of the year accounted for approximately 25% of our annual sales, while the third quarter represented approximately 45% and the fourth quarter represented approximately 30%. Your line is now live. So from an occupancy perspective, running just shy of - about $25 million per quarter with some of the M&A addition of new stores, new locations, as well as some of the new locations we're going to open this year that may pick up a little bit, but not materially higher. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. What we've seen last couple years, and I think - probably a good indicator from the first quarter as well, is folks are trying to extend the season, trying to open earlier trying to close later, you typically see that through uptake of heaters, heat pumps, solar covers, other things to kind of warm that water. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Okay, second question I wanted to ask and I guess that's the 100 question on gross margin in the quarter, you probably had the worst mix headwind, you're going to have and did 76 basis points, year-over-year, balance of the year is 15 to 25. Your line is now live."
