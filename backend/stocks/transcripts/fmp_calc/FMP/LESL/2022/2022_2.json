    "content": " As you will remember, we estimated at the time that the freeze and accompanying spike in demand increased sales in the quarter by approximately $10 million. Our loyalty program Leslie's Pool Perks drove loyalty file growth of 2% in the quarter, despite the comparison against the Texas Freeze last year. Based on our acquisitions completed year-to-date, we are increasing our 2022 forecasted sales for our M&A strategic growth initiative from $30 million to $45 million. We reported record sales of $228.1 million, an increase of 18.5% or $35.7 million when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As Mike mentioned, in the second quarter of last year, the Texas Freeze positively impacted performance by approximately $10 million. With positive adjusted EBITDA performance in each of the first and second quarter of this year, we're on track to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in each quarter of fiscal year for the first time in Leslie's recent history. Total sales for the 26-week period increased 22.4% to $412.9 million from $337.4 million in the prior year, an increase of $75.5 million. We ended the second quarter of fiscal 2022 with inventory of $345 million, up 24% compared to $278 million at the end of the prior year quarter. With regard to debt, at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022, funded debt less cash was $795 million, compared to $721 million at the end of the prior year quarter. In fiscal 2021, the first half of the year accounted for approximately 25% of our annual sales while the third quarter represented approximately 45% and the fourth quarter represented approximately 30%. We expect sales of $1,575 million to $1,610 million, representing an increase of 17% to 20% compared to the prior year. At the midpoint, this is a $38 million increase compared to our outlook in February and the improvement in gross margin over the prior year is in line with our long-term growth algorithm of flat to positive 25 basis points per year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $315 million to $330 million, representing an increase of 16% to 22% compared to the prior year. We expect diluted adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 to $1.10, representing an increase of 20% to 29% compared to the prior year. In summary, during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we generated record sales, reported positive EBITDA, and continue to see strong results from our growth initiatives, and we're grateful for the contributions of our entire team, as they continue to execute at a high level in the current environment. One, we are benefiting from strong secular macro trends that are driving durable consumer demand and are showing no signs of slowing; two, we operate in an industry that is able to pass costs through to consumers and we have the ability to take pricing action to protect product margins; three, more than 80% of our assortment is nondiscretionary and benefits from recurring annuity-like demand; and four, we have a long history of strong and consistent free cash flow generation that enables both continued investment in our business, as well as opportunistic return of capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. One, we have tangible strategic growth initiatives and unique to our industry omni capabilities that are driving meaningful results and are still early stage in their development; two, our multipronged PRO initiative continues to scale; three, we have set ourselves up to capitalize on robust M&A opportunities we continue to see in the pool and spa industry; four, great execution by our merchandising team has put us in a favorable and advantaged inventory position. So if you look at SG&A for the quarter, it was relatively high at $19 million increase or up 27%."
