    "content": " Our strategic investments strengthened our platform advantage most recently demonstrated with the successful launch of Accu-Trade and the integration of CreditIQ As a result, we saw accelerated revenue growth in each quarter of 2022, delivering $654 million of revenue for the full year, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Even with this headwind and the continued challenges with OEM production and delayed model launches, we accelerated our revenue growth each quarter of the year, culminating in 6% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter and grew ARPD by $28 compared to the prior year. Revenue grew each quarter and fourth quarter revenue reached $168 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Performance was driven by growth in dealer revenue, which also grew 6% year-over-year to $149 million. Revenue totaled $654 million and dealer revenue was $579 million, both were up 5% compared to the prior year. I think what's important to know though is like despite the fact that we have been experiencing cancels from digital dealers, the overall traditional dealer base continues to be extremely strong, if not for the cancellations that we were experiencing with digital dealers instead of 2% year-over- year growth in dealer customers, we would have seen 4% year-over-year growth in dealer customers. Like, the gear growth, if you excluded digital dealers, the impact of that, I think you said it was up 4% in the quarter year-over-year."
