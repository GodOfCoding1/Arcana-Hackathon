    "content": " Our expectation for the second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 26% to 28% reflects the impact of our projected revenue mix with lower OEM revenue and growing solutions revenue as well as higher year-over-year expenses as we continue to invest in marketing and in our people, including the integration and launch of our recently acquired dealer solutions. Your line is open. We were very pleased with the dealer growth in the quarter and see a continued opportunity to add dealers to our platform because, to your point, we've got a range of solutions that start from entry level to people like we feature in the call who participate with us across the full enterprise suite of solutions. Your line is open. I mean dealerships are spending, in some cases, in excess of $10,000 a month on various tools from different suppliers that, frankly, we can bring them all together through Accu-Trade -- whether that's pricing and analytics or trade-in widgets on their Web site or third-party services that allow them to source cars, in many cases, dealerships have three to five different vendors trying to do these things for them at any given time. Your line is open. Well, first of all, I think even what's interesting, if you look at inventory levels on the new car side, we know those are down massively, but the used car business still remains very robust and dealerships do have healthy levels of inventory, particularly those that are relying on tech to acquire cars and keep inventory levels flush. Your line is open. Your line is open."
