    "content": " Performance was driven by growth in dealer revenue, which grew 5% year-over-year to $144 million as a result of 4% growth in dealer customers and 1% growth in ARPD, which was driven by continued adoption of our digital solutions. The value we deliver attracts and retains dealers, evidenced by growth of 672 dealers or 4% year-over-year, putting us at 19,517 dealer customers at quarter end. We continue to push for growth in the universe of approximately 40,000 dealers in the U.S. At June 30, we had 5,650 website customers, up 650 from a year ago and up 150 sequentially. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately $163.5 million to $165.5 million, representing continued solid year-over-year growth as well as sequential growth. Tom, we really expect ARPD to be the growth -- the driver of our growth here with the solutions that we're rolling out with Accu-Trade, with continued growth in DI and even the stability in the marketplace dealer customers and the core business."
