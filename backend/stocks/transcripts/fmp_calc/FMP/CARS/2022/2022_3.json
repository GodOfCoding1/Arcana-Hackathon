    "content": " For the quarter, adjusted operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $113 million, $2 million higher than a year ago as a result of the addition of the CreditIQ and Accu-Trade acquisitions and other investments to drive growth. Compared to the second quarter, our adjusted operating expenses were $3 million lower, driven by lower marketing spend as a result of our strong growth in traffic and unique visitors, which enabled us to pull back on marketing investments during the third quarter. Driven by sustained strong retention rates and new sales, we grew customers by 556 dealers or 3% year-over-year, putting us at 19,585 at quarter end. And so, this time next year I think we'd like to see not only our subscription numbers more than double, but I think the early progress around dealer-to-dealer trading, we'd like to get that launched sometime next year where dealers can now start to trade inventory using Cars.com retail demand data to help inform time to sale and informing them when they should get rid of a car and perhaps sell it to a dealer in another region."
