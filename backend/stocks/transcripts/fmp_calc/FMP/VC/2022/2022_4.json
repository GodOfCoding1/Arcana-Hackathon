    "content": " Our industry-leading digital cockpit electronics products performed very well, resulting in full year sales of $3,756 million, an increase of 35% over last year, compared with our customers vehicle production growth of approximately 5%. Adjusted EBITDA was $348 million, or 9.3% of sales, an increase of $120 million over last year. However, we expect that our strong new product launch performance in the past two years plus additional launches in 2023, will continue to drive market outperformance with base sales excluding customer recoveries, growing in the mid-teens. Despite this challenging environment Visteon's compounded annual sales growth was 21%, benefiting from a robust set of product launches, proactive supply-chain management and customer recoveries. Compared to prior year, sales in 2022 grew 35% growth over market excluding pricing was 21% while customer recoveries offset by annual price-downs was a positive contributor of 14%. Excluding customer recoveries, base sales were approximately $3.26 billion in 2022, an increase of 28% compared to 2020, while production volumes increased 10% in the same periods. Your line is open.
