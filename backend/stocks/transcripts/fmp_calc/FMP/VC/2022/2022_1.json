    "content": " First quarter sales were $818 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year and excluding currency and 22% growth over market as vehicle production at our customers declined approximately 11%. Despite the lower vehicle production, Visteon sales came in strong at $818 million, up 11% compared to prior year when excluding the impact of currency. The company continues to build on the foundation for future growth with the launch of 16 new products and new business wins of approximately $950 million in the quarter, we secured incremental business that expanded relationship with key customers and continue to build momentum for key growth drivers for years to come. So we're maintaining the guidance for the full year on the sales side as well as on the EBITDA, the -- one of the key assumptions that we have for the full year is the fact that we are capping inflation leakage at a level of $20 million exactly per our original guidance. But it's true that the recovery since we've seen, in fact, a pretty steady increase of cost in, I would say, towards the end of Q4, but as well in Q1, we had to pass on more to our customers, that as well benefits not only sales but growth-over-market. So what has happened is there are several facilities of semiconductor suppliers in and around Shanghai whether for back-end processing or in some cases, just the distribution centers, which have had to be locked down or operate at lower capacity on account of what's happening in Shanghai that will cause an air bubble in the supply that will impact us as an industry in the second quarter, but that issue is much less severe than other disruptions we have faced for example, last year, because there has been no loss of any bip or any wafers."
