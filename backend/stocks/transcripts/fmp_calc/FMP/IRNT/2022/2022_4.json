But the more fundamental point, which I think really is encouraging is that our revenue mix and the transaction particularly \u2013 traction particularly with community customers is where we've actually been doing a lot of work on market penetration and getting a good establishment there, which is really what's been really the other part of the fourth quarter driver for our margins. I think in terms of how to think about margins going forward, and that's really where \u2013 take a look at the overall year and leaving aside the accounting charges, the native margin for the period was effectively 70%, which is where we've wanted to be as a SaaS company, and that's before a number of the changes that we've been recently working in through our technology architecture improvements that should easily drive us and keep us solidly in the low 70% range and pushing forward on \u2013 in margins as we go through fiscal 2022 \u2013 2023, sorry. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. But do keep in mind that full-year guide of getting some good accelerating linearity through second, third and fourth to get us up to that revenue number of 34 and similar accelerating growth in ARR coming off of first quarter here for second, third and fourth that get us on up to that 50% year-over-year growth rate. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
