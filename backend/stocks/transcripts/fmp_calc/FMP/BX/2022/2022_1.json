    "content": " In our nearly $300 billion real estate business, approximately 80% of the equity portfolio in sectors, where rents in the U.S. are growing significantly in excess of the rate of inflation, owning hard assets has historically provided a strong hedge for inflation which favors our $27 billion infrastructure business as well. For our $125 billion corporate private equity platform, our operating companies grew a remarkable 20% \u2013 22% year-over-year in the first quarter partially benefiting from reopening tailwinds. And then the other point I\u2019d make is lots of our products are really well positioned for the environment we\u2019re going into, which would be, if you think about owning hard assets like infrastructure, real estate, owning floating rate debt, like we do in our direct lending platform, that\u2019s really attractive. Brian, please go ahead. And so I think it\u2019s, again, one of the great strengths of our firm that in an environment where there may be some headwinds around private equity fundraising, it benefits another part of our firm, our secondaries business which has, again, delivered really great performance over time because of the structural inefficiencies in the market. Brian, please go ahead."
