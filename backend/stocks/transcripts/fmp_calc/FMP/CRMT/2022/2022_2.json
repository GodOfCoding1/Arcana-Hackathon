    "content": " Our customers see real value in these products and they\u2019re priced at a value for them to increase success rates, like we\u2019ve talked about the new service contracts with the longer terms and the way we have to defer and recognize revenue on those we\u2019ll continue to add to our revenue stream as we go forward. And as a result those percentages have come down a little bit, but as we go forward and get more clarity on where the market\u2019s going, then we do have the ability to tweak our retail pricing, but we always have to keep in mind that customer success rate, customer equity and we are truly in the boat with our customers over that contract term, and we\u2019re working with them to complete those contracts and get titled to the car. We\u2019re looking at that and monitoring that, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not going to change the way we approach our customers, and their success, and tax time refunds are just around the corner, and we expect our consumer base to perform well with or without these additional child credits."
