    "content": " The car that we're looking for, that wholesale car under $10,000 is still pretty tight supply and we think it's going to stay that way for an extended period of time, but we are starting to see a little more availability and we do expect that gross margin dollar amount to continue to increase with the sales price increases and the percentage itself may be a little challenge, just a little bit and -- but we are seeing the market share gains. And then the second question is actually a follow-up to Kyle's gross margin question, I think the gross margin's kind of been what's driving the stock this morning, but is it simply -- so gross margin percentages, if they're going to simply be just following what used car prices are doing or are there actions that you can take or other things that can be done in order to improve the margin since I remember in the past you've talked about different ways of sourcing inventory and other ways, but I was just wondering, is this something where we should just be, say, just looking at used car prices and building at it from the 38% you did this quarter or is there something else that you can do to improve that? But again, we're picking up market share, our pricing at the retail side is matching up very nicely and I think that's a big reason that we're seeing our volume improvements in a pretty difficult market with higher prices is that folks that had choices are looking at our offering and looking at our pricing and deciding that that's a good choice and with everything we're doing after the sales, service contract, oil changes, roadside assistance and everything we do here to keep those customers on the road, I think that is a reason that we're seeing increased market share and expect to continue to see productivity improvements as we go forward, but again, those gross margin percentages are probably going to stay in that 38% range and maybe even go a little lower as we go up on sales price."
