    "content": " Additionally, significant wholesale drag resulted from quality challenges due to product shortages, our inability to get repairs process timely for cars that were designated for retail but because of delays and capacity issues ended up they hope to and the decrease in wholesale prices for older model cars which began in the early summer months. Our corporate procurement efforts are designed to supply our dealerships with most of their product needs at good prices in retail-ready condition, allowing our talented and dedicated dealership staff, led by the general managers, to spend their time working on the business and profitably growing the number of customers we serve. Along with the expectation that used vehicle prices will continue to level off and decrease, we expect to be taking significant costs out of our procurement channels, while at the same time improving quality while leveraging strong partnerships throughout the chain, specifically reconditioning partners. With vehicle prices coming down some, our procurement efforts improving quickly and the LOS rolling out, we will be in a great spot to pick up higher credit quality customers as we've seen during prior recessionary periods. I've sort of looked at the time period and locked in January 1 and sort of restated that index from January 1, 2020, prices went up, I'd call it, probably close to 40% on the cohort of vehicles, we really stay focused on sort of reaching a crescendo there in December of last year."
