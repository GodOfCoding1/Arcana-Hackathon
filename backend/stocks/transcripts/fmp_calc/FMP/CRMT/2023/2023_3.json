    "content": " As Doug mentioned, the average selling price was up $1,341 for the quarter versus the prior quarter with only a 2.1 month increase in the term compared to the prior year third quarter. Going forward, as we stated in the press release, over the next three to five years, we expect to generate returns on equity at historical levels by increasing volume productivity, improving gross margins as a function of procurement initiatives by leveraging SGMA and through acquisitions of well operated dealerships."
