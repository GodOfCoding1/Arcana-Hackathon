    "content": " Our revenue in the first quarter of 2022 at $1.37 billion, exceeded the revenue reported in the first three quarters of last year combined through the powerful combination of higher average sales prices, and increases in volume from both organic growths in existing markets, and new market expansions. As the market changes and we start seeing more supply, this is where we can really flex our renovation muscle and we actually as you're competing against more homes for a buyer to buy, having nice renovation in those homes becomes more important. So I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes to that and markets are behaving differently going forward, and then looking at your 2Q value feels like there's a change in the top line  Just curious, if you can double quick on that a little bit more and explain how much about is to pull forward into 1Q. But on the downturn, in the market where there's more supply, and your -- that's something that we can really flex on, because as homeowners have more trouble selling their home and it goes back to a normalized, let's say, 3 to 4 to 5 months selling period using -- coming to Offerpad where they can close in their schedule it's gonna be that much more valuable."
