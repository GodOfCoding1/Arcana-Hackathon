    "content": " Burcon's fiscal 2023 first quarter, which ended June 30, carried forward momentum from the previous quarter in which Burcon and its joint venture, Merit Functional Foods continued to make significant progress. During the quarter, Merit continued to scale up production and throughput capabilities quality and yield for its unique pea and canola protein ingredients through continuous process improvements of its dual process production facility, the complexity of operating a dual process facility where Merit has to switch between two entirely different starting agricultural crops and processes them into pure protein ingredients, requires careful management of control systems and process parameters that affect the overall outcome of the final product. During the quarter, Merit successfully optimized and implemented a new process developed by Burcon to produce Peazazz C, a uniquely different pea protein ingredient that combines some of the best attributes arising from Burcon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary processing technologies, attributes such as exceptional taste, high solubility, low viscosity and functionality that allows for smooth, grit free texture, even when used in high protein inclusion levels. During the quarter, our potential partners completed a number of critical due diligence items that included product testing, process and technology evaluation and market analysis, all of which helped support our strategic discussions with the goal to commercializing Burcon's protein technologies in partnership with an established food ingredients player."
