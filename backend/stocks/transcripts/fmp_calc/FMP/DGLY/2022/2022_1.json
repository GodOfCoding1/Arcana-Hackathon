    "content": " He\u2019ll go into an in-depth details of the numbers and the operation, but excited to see us come in with at the first quarter numbers in excess of $10 million that was pretty much in line with what our expectations were, which also sort of helps us validate and continue to believe in our $50 million guidance that we\u2019ve given for 2022. Let\u2019s look at first, our legacy business, which is law and commercial video systems, excuse me, revenues from products declined to $1.3 million from $1.9 million in the year ago quarter. The \u2013 would I attribute the change in revenues in the legacy business really due to the introduction of new products, which we\u2019re very excited about by the way, it\u2019s in the body cam area, we introduced the FirstVu Pro and the FirstVu II in the fourth \u2013 late in the fourth quarter 2021 and as you might expect our channel, our cost, our inventory channels were clogged and we had difficulty getting them in. And our dental billing acquisition is kind of breaks the mold a little bit in that \u2013 it uses a national footprint, they\u2019re recruiting and trying to acquire new customers on a nationwide basis, whereas our medical billing companies are much more regional, local to regional businesses. I mean, obviously the legacy business is an essential business, with law enforcement, the commercial business where, when you\u2019re talking about trucking companies and fleets along those side of things, they\u2019re virtually essential, the medical billing essential, so a little bit of the wild card would be the ticketing, but it with what we\u2019re doing and picking out venues that are more stadium, maybe enclosed to where, weather won\u2019t come into play as much, some things along those lines."
