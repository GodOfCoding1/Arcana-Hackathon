    "content": " We had a strong top line revenue performance with $9 million in commercial revenue in Q3 2022, which is a 30% increase over the same period the prior year, and a 9% increase on a consecutive quarter basis. In early September, the Ministry of Health and Labor and Welfare, commonly known as MHLW, granted the RECELL System marketing approval for the treatment of acute burns in Japan with very favorable reimbursement of JPY 970,000 for our standard device, which is approximately $7,000 converted at the current exchange rate. With regard to the soft tissue repair market, we are prioritizing our soft tissue repair launch, given our existing codes, the overlap with Level 1 and 2 trauma centers and our existing Burn Center customer base and the ability to leverage and expand our current Salesforce. Looking at this strategically, our growth in 2023 and 2024 will be driven by the penetration of the burn and soft tissue repair markets in the US, followed by the achievement of reimbursement for vitiligo for a full launch in January 2025. Our commercial revenue, which excludes BARDA revenue, increased by 30% or $2.1 million to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $9 million in the three months ended September 30th, 2022 compared to $6.9 million in the corresponding period in the prior year. Turning to guidance, full year 2022 commercial revenue guidance is revised and increased to a range of $33 million to $34 million from $30 million excluding BARDA revenues, which represents an approximate 33% increase year over year.
