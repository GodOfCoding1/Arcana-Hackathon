    "content": " This year, our catalogs expanded scope became the foundation for Career Academy, an institutional offering that brings together our Professional Certificates and guided projects into a solution that businesses, governments and campuses can deliver at scale to help individuals with no college degree or prior work experience start a new career or switch careers into an entry-level digital job. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So I think it's kind of a government is saying, well, look, we're going to have more dislocation than we thought because of technology, but maybe with these types of industry credentials, we can help more of our people take advantage of and get a share of the kind of opportunity that's coming from that technological change. And then I think on the Coursera for Business side, it's still earlier days, but what we're seeing in the U.S. is a number of employers who are saying I want to track more frontline workers and they're looking for a career development benefit. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Well, if you can get working adults to start with an industry micro credential and then have that be the on-ramp to an online degree that people can take while they're working, that's a system that benefits departments of labor because they could help retrain their working adults and universities so that they can recruit and serve a population of learners who traditionally they just didn't serve before. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
