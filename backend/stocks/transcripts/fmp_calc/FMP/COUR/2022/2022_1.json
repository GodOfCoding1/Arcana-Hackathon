    "content": " As you'll hear in this quarter's highlights, and more importantly, in the slate of public announcements planned in connection with Coursera's conference next week, we're working with our ecosystem of partners and institutions to broaden access for more learners for more countries around the globe. In each of these programs, 3 key features of Coursera play a critical role, including our scale and reach, particularly our ability to serve an entire state or nationwide workforce initiative; the collaboration between academic institutions, industry and government fostered by our 3-sided platform; and the world-class content and credentials from leading university and industry brands."
