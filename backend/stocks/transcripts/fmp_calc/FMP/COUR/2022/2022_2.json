Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So if you look at where the Degree segment revenue comes from, currently, with our current portfolio Degrees, our four largest most mature Degree programs, they saw limited to negative revenue growth year-over-year and three of these four in the U.S. We think that what's going on when we look at our funnel and also sort of outside information of what's happening with other degree providers in the U.S. market, we think that there are economic trends, particularly in the U.S. associated with a strong labor market and the stronger labor market historically has led to lower enrollments.
