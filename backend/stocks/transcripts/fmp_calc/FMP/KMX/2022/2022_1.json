    "content": " For the first quarter of FY '22, our diversified business model delivered sales of $7.7 billion, up 138% compared with the first quarter of FY '21 and net earnings per diluted share of $2.63, up $2.60 from a year ago. Across our retail and wholesale channels, we sold approximately 452,000 cars, up 128% versus the first quarter last year and a 31% increase on a two-year basis from the first quarter of FY '20. Together with the strong gross profit growth in retail and wholesale Bill just discussed, other gross profits increased to $142 million, up $111 million from last year's first quarter. Service growth of $42 million or 125%, driven by labor leverage due to our strong sales performance and prior year company support pay; and an improvement in third-party finance fees of $6 million or 57% due to our renegotiated fee structure and changes in tier penetration, partially offset by increased sales. Compensation leveraged by 25.8 percentage points versus last year, a $38 million increase in advertising expense driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend to amplify the CarMax brand, build awareness of our omni-channel offerings and drive customer acquisition. For the first quarter, CAF's penetration net of free-day payoffs was 43.7% compared with 36.1% a year ago. I mean when we talk about looking back to FY '20, don't forget the first quarter in FY '20 was a 9.5% comp and we're comping 16% on top of that. I mean our inventory level right now, is I think -- obviously, we're below target the whole quarter, we're probably 40% lower than where we would like to be."
