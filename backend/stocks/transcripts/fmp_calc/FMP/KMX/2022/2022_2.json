    "content": " This was driven by wholesale vehicle margin of $189 million, which was up 31%, and used vehicle margin of $507 million, which was up 5% from last year\u2019s second quarter. While penetration was stable at above 60%, last year\u2019s second quarter included a benefit of approximately $8 million in profit sharing revenues that was not recognized this year due to a timing shift in the performance period for one of our providers. Again ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press the star then the one key on your touchtone telephone. Well David, just so we\u2019re clear, the GPU, if you look at it--like, last year, second quarter was a record GPU and we\u2019re only a little bit off of that, so I would say if you look at our historical average, we\u2019re on the higher end of GPU. Last year in the first quarter, they were negative 42%, and so you\u2019re looking at a lot more volume from a 90-day perspective warranty work that carries over into the subsequent quarter, so that very much is a timing play right there. Again ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press the star then the one key on your touchtone telephone."
