    "content": " Our results for the first quarter are $1.33 billion and adjusted revenue, up 5.5% and $1.10 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, down 11%. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA was $464.3 million for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 35.4%. Results for the second quarter were GAAP revenues of $1,328.7 billion, GAAP net income of $110.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.42. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $455.3 million, a decrease of $40.5 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of 2021. On our balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the second quarter with $438.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $7.4 million of gross debt. Operating cash flows were down as a result of several factors, including payment of transaction expenses associated with the Blue Prism acquisition of approximately $67 million, which includes amounts paid by Blue Prism in the post-acquisition period and our operating activities compared to last year. In the 6 months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve declared and paid $102.4 million of common stock to adds as compared to $82.1 million last year, an increase of 24.6%. Adjusted organic growth in the range of 0.6% to 4.8%, adjusted net income in the range of $1.256 billion to $1.297 billion and diluted shares in the range of $264.6 million to $263.6 million. I think if you look at the baseline costs for Q2, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got in the back half of the year about $50 million in cost reductions, of which you think about $25 million have already been completed."
