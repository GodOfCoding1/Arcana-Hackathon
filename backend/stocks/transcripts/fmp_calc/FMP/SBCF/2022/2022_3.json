    "content": " The quarter was highlighted by a material expansion of our net interest margin, which, excluding PPP and accretion on acquired loans, increased 29 basis points from the prior quarter, and net interest income increased 32% on an annualized basis. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on growing our broad base of revenue sources and with the benefit of the expanded franchise, we expect fourth quarter noninterest income in a range from $18 million to $22 million, which is inclusive of the operations of both Apollo and Drammen. The allowance for credit losses increased during the quarter by $4.6 million to an overall $95.3 million, with an increase in coverage of 3 basis points to 1.42%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So if you step back and look at the position of our balance sheet, and look at the capital we carry, the reserves and the allowance, the reserves and the purchase marks, the strong, diverse core customer base and the discipline we've executed over time -- and then you combine that with what Florida has been, particularly over the last 3 or 4 years, if you look at the amount of wealth accumulation that's coming to market, the economic drivers I definitely think that Florida outperforms through this cycle. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But as we go into this period and when I look forward into what probably is the most important thing we can be focused on, which is funding and deposits, having a really well put together C&I-focused commercial banking team and then complementing that with really strong treasury officers in combination with a lot of the investment we made in technology late and early late last year, early this year, I think it really does put us in a position to begin to take material market share over the next years. Your line is now open."
