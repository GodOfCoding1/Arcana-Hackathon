    "content": " The Seacoast team delivered another outstanding quarter of earnings and growth, generating $41.7 million in pretax pre-provision earnings, 7% annualized loan growth across multiple loan categories and an impressive 25% annualized growth in deposit outstandings. Outside of growth related to acquisitions, organic deposits were up over 6% this quarter and 25% annualized due in large part to new commercial relationships and an expanding Florida economy. In the securities portfolio, we've continued to pace our investments of excess liquidity with ending balances higher by $171 million and yields increasing 11 basis points to 1.68%. Wealth management income was higher by $300,000 or 13% from the prior quarter as we continue to successfully add new relationships. With new purchases in the second quarter, we will continue to steadily pace our investments, expecting net growth of approximately $150 million to $250 million. Outside of the growth coming from the two bank acquisitions, organic deposits increased 6% this quarter or 25% annualized, with much of that growth coming from new commercial relationships generated by the expansion of our commercial banking franchise. The allowance for credit losses increased during the quarter by $6.5 million to an overall $89.8 million, with the increase in loan balances from organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by slightly lower coverage."
