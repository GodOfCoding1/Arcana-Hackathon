    "content": " So, Private Bank revenues up 4%, our continued strong growth in client assets of 26% including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength et cetera, and as Jane mentioned even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering, which again is targeted towards U.S. consumer and wealth management clients and so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here. So, I think as we will hear from us going forward more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one, there are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by Securities Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable particularly given our pre and post-trade capabilities. So, if revenues come in meaningfully different, there is a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around, but aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards, in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that."
