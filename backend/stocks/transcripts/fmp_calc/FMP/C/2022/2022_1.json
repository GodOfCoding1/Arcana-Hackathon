    "content": " As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02, with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51% largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think what we\u2019ve seen, frankly, Mike, across the board this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets, we had a lot of strong corporate activity and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, great with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
