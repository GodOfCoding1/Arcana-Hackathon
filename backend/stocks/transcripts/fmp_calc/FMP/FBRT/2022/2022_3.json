    "content": " We paid an aggregate amount of common stock dividend of $0.355 per share for the quarter, and that represents a yield of 9% on our fully converted book value of $15.84, and its - 93% of that was covered by our distributable earnings this quarter. Our traditional multi-tenant office exposure when excluding those two loans is only 5% of the total portfolio and has an average loan exposure under $25 million, we believe our office portfolio to be very manageable at these levels. In addition, shortly after the beginning of Q4, we received approximately $1.1 million of back and current rent directly from Walgreens and will continue to see rental payments across the entire portfolio directly from Walgreens going forward of approximately $1.1 million per quarter."
