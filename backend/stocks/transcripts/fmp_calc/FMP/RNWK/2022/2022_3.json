    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of negative $5.8 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of negative $2.7 million in the prior year period. Consumer Media revenue in the third quarter 2022 decreased $1.3 million year-over-year, driven primarily due to timing of contract renewals and shipments to existing customers. Mobile Services revenue was $5.2 million, a decrease of $0.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by lower ICM and lower RBT subscriptions, partially offset by higher sales of SAFR. Consolidated gross profit in the third quarter was $8.9 million compared to $11.2 million in the prior year, driven by lower revenue. This decrease was due to lower salaries and other people-related costs, lower restructuring and lower marketing costs, offset in part by $2.2 million in higher professional service fees associated with the company's engagement of legal and financial advisers who assisted the special committee of our Board of Directors in evaluating Mr. Glaser's acquisition proposal and pending merger and subsequent legal work associated with drafting the proxy and reviewing it with the SEC."
