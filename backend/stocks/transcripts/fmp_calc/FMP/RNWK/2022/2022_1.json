    "content": " Our total revenue in the quarter was $13.3 million, down from $15.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 and essentially flat compared with Q4 of 2021. In the first quarter, revenue in the SAFR business increased by 22% compared to the first quarter of 2021. At an approximate price point of $1,200 and with comparable products in the market today selling for anywhere between $25 and $5,000, SAFR SCAN is an attractive and viable alternative to key cards and fingerprint, providing access to a significant customer base. Consumer Media revenue in the first quarter of 2022 decreased $1.2 million year-over-year, driven primarily by our IP business. Games revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was down approximately $1.1 million compared to the prior year, essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Consolidated gross profit in the first quarter was $10.5 million compared to $12.2 million the prior year, driven by lower revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to $3.2 million of restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $300,000 in Q1 2022. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2022, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $11 million to $12.5 million and adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $6 million to $4.5 million."
