    "content": " If we look at our net loss for the quarter $400,000 compared to a gain from last year, it's important to note that we have a $3.4 million one-time gain from selling our Lake Barrington building last year to help with that reduction. Looking at our adjusted EBITDA which is detailed in our non-GAAP measure in the press release, we posted a $0.5 million improvement during the second quarter, and a $1.25 million improvement during the six-month period over last year."
