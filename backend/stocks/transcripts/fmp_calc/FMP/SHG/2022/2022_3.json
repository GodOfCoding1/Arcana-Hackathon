    "content": " In today's presentation we have with us our main presenter, CFO, Lee Tae Kyung of the Group; the Group CMO, Heo Young-Taeg; the Group CRO, Bang Dong-Kwon; the Group CDO, Kim Myoung Hee; the Group CSSO, Ko Seok Hon; from Shinhan Bank CFO, Jung Sang Hyuk; Shinhan Card CFO, Moon Dong Kwon; Shinhan Financial Investment CFO, Keum Sung Weon; and finally; Shinhan Life CFO, Park Kyoung Won. The fee income is down 16.1% QoQ and the decline owes itself to the fall in credit card income on the back of merchant fee, refund, and growth in the seasonal promotional expense despite the solid growth of the credit purchase, absence of investment banking fees related to IPO, and the real estate big deal that occurred in the first half and the contraction of brokerage commissions. In the case of non-banking subsidiaries, Shinhan Cards recurring net income decreased somewhat despite the growth in credit purchases and operating assets increased, driven by business diversification efforts due to rapid hikes in funding costs and the merchant fee cuts. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
