    "content": " As of the end of Q4, cumulative number of users with approved credit lines reached approximately 44.5 million, and cumulative borrowers with successful drawdowns reached approximately 27 million, up by 16% and 11% year-over-year, respectively. Q4 and full-year 2022 capital light loan facilitation, ICE and other technology solutions combined account for roughly 56% of total loan volume. And also we said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we saw the management give a relatively conservative loan origination of growth guidance for this year, which is like 10% to 20% year-on-year growth, which is just below the loan volume growth guidance like last year, which is 15% to 25% year-on-year growth. In terms of the quarters  pace, we expect it will ramp up throughout the year, which means the loan volume will grow quarter-by-quarter because we believe the credit needs will benefit from the recovery of the consumer's behavior. But if we look at the short-terms, we will actually adjust to the loan volume contribution from the asset light business model based on our assessments of the macro environment and credit risk associated with the macro."
