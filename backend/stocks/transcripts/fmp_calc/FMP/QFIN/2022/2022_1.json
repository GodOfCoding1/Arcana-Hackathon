    "content": " On the business brands, our strategy and focus this year is to structure optimization of our user base and funding sources to enhance user lifetime value and increase the sustainable contribution of high-quality fundings, therefore, further improve our operational resilience. During the quarter, sales and marketing expense declined approximately 12% q-on-q mainly because of the Chinese New Year holiday, as well as our prudent control of the pace of our user acquisition. Although, overall risk profile of our user -- of our loan portfolio modestly improved in Q1, due to the contribution from high-quality new users, the impacts from macro uncertainty and COVID resurgence were still noticeable among existing users."
