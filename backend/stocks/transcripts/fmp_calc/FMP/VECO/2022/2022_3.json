    "content": " Our revenue of $172 million was above the midpoint of our guide and driven by another record quarter in Semiconductor, with significant contributions from Laser Annealing, as well as Systems for Advanced Packaging, and EUV Mask Blank production. Despite current headwinds stemming from the consumer markets I just mentioned, over the long-term, the Semiconductor market is driven by secular growth drivers include \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including megatrends such as AI and High Performance Computing, the transformation of the Auto Industry, and ongoing Data Center and Cloud adoption. Revenue totaled $172 million for the quarter, and as Bill mentioned, was driven by record sales to our Semiconductor customers, which increased 3% sequentially from Q2 2022 and 32% from a year ago. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yeah, I would say given our long lead times and having orders kind of start you know in the second quarter and then into the third quarter here, our Data Storage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we believe our Data Storage business will be up next year over this year, and it will likely be more concentrated in the second half of the year, just given the lead times. Your line is open."
