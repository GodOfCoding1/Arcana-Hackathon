    "content": " For our deliveries business, we saw solid growth despite the normalization of food delivery demand and our continued focus on cultivating and retaining high-quality users.\\ In the quarter, revenue for deliveries tripled compared to the same period a year ago as we optimize our incentive spend and launch product enhancements to reduce our cost to serve. Revenue growth for overall Financial Services grew by 44% year-on-year, driven by higher contributions from our lending business. For GMV for the third quarter, we recorded growth of 26% year-on-year to reach $5.1 billion, also an all-time high. For our mobility segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved year-on-year from 12% to 12.5%, a 41 basis point improvement and in line with our expected steady state assumptions. For Financial Services, adjusted EBITDA declined 38% year-on-year, while as a percentage of TPV, it shifted from negative 2.4% to negative 2.7% due to higher expenses in our digital banking business unit. However, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, Financial Services segment adjusted EBITDA improved 9% with GrabFin segment expenses declining by 4%. As such, we expect deliveries GMV in the fourth quarter to grow 5% to 10% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, factoring in roughly six percentage points FX headwind in the fourth quarter based on exchange rate forecast.
