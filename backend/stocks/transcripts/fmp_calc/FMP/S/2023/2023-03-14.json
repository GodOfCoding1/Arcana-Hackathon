    "content": " Our platform breadth across endpoint, cloud, identity and data delivers best-in-class security and value for our customers and diverse growth opportunities for our business across multiple large TAMs. On today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover three key areas: one, details of our quarterly performance showing outperformance on all key metrics, better execution and stronger competitive position; two, we are focusing our investments and roadmap in areas of key technology differentiation, large addressable markets and critical enterprise needs; three, I will discuss the broader demand environment. Let me share an example of a large financial institution that moved away from Microsoft to SentinelOne, a solid platform win where we help the customer consolidate point solutions across endpoint cloud and many other adjacent modules. Our AI-based security and unified data architecture provides performance benefits and a cost structure that allows us to remain highly competitive, enabling us to increase deal sizes and expand our gross margins, while consolidating costs and reducing complexity for our customers. In the new fiscal year, we are focusing on three core areas of innovation and product development: one, advancing our leadership in endpoint security; two, strengthening our cloud security advantage; three, expanding our platform capabilities and market opportunity. So for us right now, a lot of it is about putting into market and continuing our growth in areas like cloud security, the security data lake capability, which today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a first and only in the market for unified security data lake that can consolidate more data from other adjacent components in the enterprise."
