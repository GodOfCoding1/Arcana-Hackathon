    "content": " On today's call, I'll focus on two key areas: one, details of our quarterly performance, including customer growth and expansion as well as execution against our strategy; and two, an update on the demand environment and how we're optimally positioned to help enterprises with our autonomous XDR platform. We once again delivered substantial revenue and ARR growth, both grew over 120% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our XDR platform across endpoint, cloud and identity. By adding Attivo's comprehensive identity security capabilities to our platform, we're now protecting customers both at the device and end user level."
