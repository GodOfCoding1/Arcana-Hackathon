    "content": " We anticipate migrating more customers in Q4 and the first half of next year That said, when I look at our Q3 gross margin of 67% and how far we\u2019ve come in just the past few quarters, I see glimpse of scale and efficiency in our model. So with the expansion of the distribution, the incident response to MSSPs, all of the other players that are driving your product, does that tell us that we should be a little bit more cautious on the direct sales force contribution going into 1Q, given you look like you\u2019re significantly beating internal targets, therefore, obviously,  (ph) and sales force compensation push in the fourth quarter. But what it really means for us is, it\u2019s lead gen, it\u2019s really improving the quality of leads, and it\u2019s giving us really this flywheel and gear effect in terms of coverage because we\u2019re essentially engaging and building these force multipliers around the world of channel partners, MSSP folks as well as incident response companies all working in conjunction with SentinelOne to help improve security for companies around the world. But moreover, we\u2019re taking this new approach to XDR that we\u2019re unlocking over time, where we\u2019re actually offering better capabilities for each and every customer that uses the Scalyr of back end as their own back end right now, that creates another avenue for us to continue and monetize over time. And I think as part of that, also what we\u2019re really seeing that\u2019s exciting is increased module adoption and attachment at time of sale for new customers."
