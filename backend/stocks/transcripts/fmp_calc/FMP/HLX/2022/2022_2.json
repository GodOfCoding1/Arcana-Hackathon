    "content": " The vessels then commenced a two-well abandonment scope for another client, recently both vessels had high utilization with contracts and awarded work for the second half of 2022 and good visibility of potential further activity which is at an increasing rate now contract and it rates 40% to 50% higher than last year's rates. As a result of these one-time events in 2022 that are not expected to repeat and the visibility on 2023 contracts in hand plus visibility of further work, our current expectations for the EBITDA contribution from the Q7000 are to go from a range of $3 million to $7 million in '22 to a range of $20 million to $30 million for '23 or a year-over-year positive swing of at least $13 million."
