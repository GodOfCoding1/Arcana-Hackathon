    "content": " Highlights for the quarter include strong utilization in the Gulf of Mexico and North; Sea; the Q7000 working again in West Africa; seasonally strong robotics activity, primarily from the renewables market with increased trenching and development of our new boulder grab. The Robotics chartered vessel fleet achieved high utilization of 98% in the quarter, operating 5 vessels working 376 vessel days between ROV support, trenching and renewable works globally, working on multiple renewables projects in Europe, Asia and on the U.S. East Coast. The Q5000, again, had strong utilization of 94% in the third quarter, performing production enhancement work on 3 wells for 2 customers, utilizing the jointly owned Helix SLB 15K intervention system for one of the clients in ultra deepwater. The North Sea market continues to improve, and our business is seeing much improved utilization and achieving higher rates with both vessels contracted for the remainder of 2022. Based on our results to date, our contracted work, the improving offshore market and our expected outlook for the balance of 2022, we are adjusting our annual guidance as follows: Revenues between $785 million and $860 million; EBITDA between $100 million and $120 million; and free cash flow between breakeven and $30 million. I think the well intervention market continues to improve, and we're seeing improvement in rates and also utilization in the fourth quarter in the North Sea."
