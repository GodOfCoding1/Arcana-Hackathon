    "content": " In the first quarter, the Well Intervention fleet achieved utilization of 67% globally with 86% utilization in the Gulf of Mexico, 87% in Brazil, 100% utilization in West Africa and as expected through the winter period, we had low seasonal utilization in the North Sea. The Robotics chartered vessel fleet achieved high utilization of 90% in the quarter, operating five vessels, working a total of 323 vessel days between ROV support, trenching and renewable works globally. In Brazil, the Siem Helix 2 had 74% utilization, completing its planned regulatory maintenance period and then performed production enhancement work on two wells during the quarter. We continue to see an improving market, operating five vessels during the quarter, including the Seawell, primarily working between trenching, ROV support, decommissioning and non-oil and gas and renewables-related projects. The North Sea seasonal slowdown, the slow recovery of the North Seawell in the global market, the deployment of the Siem Helix 1 in accommodation work and four Well Intervention vessels incurring maintenance during the quarter, all combined to negatively impact our results. We believe certain transitory headwinds will make 2022 a challenging transition period including, first, the Q5000 completed its long-term partial utilization contract with BP in the second quarter of 2021, then shifted to a 3-year term call-off arrangement for the vessel. If I were to just start with the Street's expectation of $65 million EBITDA, and we've already mentioned that the impact of the two Siem vessels was $50 million, then that would imply, without the impact of the Siem vessels, we're at $115 million."
