    "content": " Over the next 5 to 10 years as government agencies and commercial payers turned to population health and outpatient home-centric care models, AdaptHealth's broad home medical equipment and supplies offerings and our ability to design custom delivery solutions will help to make us a partner of choice for those payers, healthcare systems and physicians managing care for their patients. For the first quarter ending March 31, 2022, AdaptHealth reported net revenue of $706.2 million, representing year-over-year growth of 46.5%, including a full quarter's contribution from the AeroCare acquisition that closed in February 2021 versus 2 months contribution in the year-ago quarter. So I think in terms of monetizing, I think it's really going to be a value-add for Adapt to be able to get into more value-based contracts and more value-based agreements to drive outcomes in those chronic diseases without much additional cost because I'll remind you, we don't have the cost of acquiring the patient or establishing the infrastructure to connect with that patient and interact and ultimately drive a better outcome."
