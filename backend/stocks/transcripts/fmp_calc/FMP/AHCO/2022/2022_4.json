    "content": " Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Our management team remains focused and confident in achieving the 2025 goals we shared at Capital Markets Day in September, namely to generate $4 billion in revenue, $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow of $300 million. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, AdaptHealth reported net revenue of $2.971 billion, an increase of 21% from $2.454 billion in 2021. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, AdaptHealth reported net revenue of $780.3 million, an increase of 11% from $702.1 million in 2021. Our 2023 guidance for net revenue is $3.16 billion to $3.24 billion, this represents 7.7% nonacquired growth over 2022. Our guidance for adjusted EBITDA is $650 million to $710 million, representing 14.5% growth over 2022. I would say, firstly, that if we look at the full year revenue guide, we are projecting a 7.7% increase in non-acquired growth over 2022, that is down from what we predicted previously, namely due to the factors in our rental portfolio as well as diabetes that we discussed. I would tell you that Q1 non-acquired growth, we believe, will be in the area of 6.5% to 7% nonacquired growth and will step up over the course of the year due to changes we are installing regarding sales focused commissions, incentives related to sparking growth within those rental product lines."
