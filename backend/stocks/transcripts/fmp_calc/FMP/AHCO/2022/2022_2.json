    "content": " Our record revenues of $727.6 million, the sequential growth in our second quarter Sleep business and the improvement in our EBITDA margin gives us confidence that we are entering the second half of 2022 on a strong trajectory to achieve our guidance for the year, despite inflationary pressures and supply chain issues that have affected us. Even though growth in our non-acquired business was flat for the quarter, we feel comfortable with our guidance for overall non-acquired growth of 4% for the full year, largely driven by increased census in our Sleep business and our continued growth in our diabetes business. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2022, AdaptHealth reported net revenue of $727.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17.9%. Please proceed with your question.
