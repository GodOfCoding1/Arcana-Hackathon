IGI contributed approximately $32 million to UpHealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2022 revenues, and we expect to recognize approximately 40% to 45% of that amount in 2023, assuming a late May closing of the sale transaction.

U.S. Telehealth revenue grew from $15 million in the third quarter to $17.6 million in Q4; and in Q4, represented 43% of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total revenues. Gross margins in Virtual Care Infrastructure increased from 36% in pro forma 2021 to 46% in 2022, including both the Indian and U.S. Telehealth businesses in pro forma 2021 and in the first two quarters of 2022."
