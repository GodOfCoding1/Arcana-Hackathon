    "content": " UpHealth's revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $44 million. UpHealth's revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $44 million. Services, which again includes pharmacy and behavioral health businesses, was the largest contributor with $19 million or 44% of the second quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total revenues. The company's revenue mix continues to shift toward the higher margin virtual care infrastructure and integrated care management segments, which increased from 48% of Q4 2021 total revenues and 51% of Q1 2022 revenues to 56% of second quarter revenues. As I mentioned in my remarks, we had a very, very strong quarter, from a gross margin perspective in the integrated care business, that business on sort of a normalized basis will run in the mid to high 60%, maybe low 70% gross margin basis."
