    "content": " For the Vince brand, first quarter consolidated net sales increased 34.5% to $68.2 million compared to $50.7 million in the same prior year period. Our Vince direct-to-consumer segment sales increased 45.3% to $34.8 million in the first quarter and exceeded 2019 levels, led by growth in our e-commerce business as well as double-digit growth in retail stores. The 120 basis point increase in gross margin rate compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was primarily due to favorable leveraging of distribution and other overhead costs, a nonrecurring insurance recovery as well as channel and product mix, partially offset by higher product and freight costs."
