The year-over-year increase was driven entirely by the Vince brand, which delivered third quarter consolidated net sales of $89.7 million, compared to $78.4 million in the same prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter was $39.2 million or 39.8% of net sales, as compared to $39 million or 44.6% of net sales for the third quarter of last year. The increase in SG&A dollars was driven by $4.4 million in expenses related to the wind down of the Rebecca Taylor business, which offset lower rent expense, lower consulting and other third-party costs, as well as lower marketing and lower incentive compensation expenses during the period. Operating loss for the third quarter, which includes the $11.1 million in costs associated with the wind down of the Rebecca Taylor business was $9.4 million, compared to operating income of $3.1 million in the same period last year.
