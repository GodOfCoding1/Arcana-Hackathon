    "content": " For the Vince brand, second quarter consolidated net sales increased 20.5% to $80.9 million compared to $67.2 million in the same prior year period. The 420 basis point decrease in gross margin rate compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was primarily due to unfavorable year-over-year adjustments to inventory reserves, higher product and freight costs, as well as an increase in promotional activity, partially offset by favorable leveraging of distribution and other overhead costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter was $39 million or 43.7% of net sales as compared to $32.7 million or 41.6% of net sales for the second quarter of last year. As of July 30, 2022 we no longer anticipate annual ordinary income for the fiscal year, mainly due to the decline in results of Rebecca Taylor and therefore the tax provision of $7.9 million for the three months ended July 30 reflects the impact of applying the company's estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year for the six month pre-tax loss. Net loss for the second quarter, which includes the impact of the impairment charges I previously review was $15 million or $1.23 loss per share compared to a net loss of $0.6 million or a $0.05 loss per share in the second quarter last year."
