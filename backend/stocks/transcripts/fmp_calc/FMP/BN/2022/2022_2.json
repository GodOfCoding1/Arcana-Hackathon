    "content": " We ended the quarter with $392 billion of fee-bearing capital, that's not including the $15 billion raised after quarter end, which was up 21% compared to the prior year. As major economies opened up over the last few years, we maintained our patient approach to capital allocation, purposely keeping our portfolio in a short duration and highly liquid position, maintaining approximately $25 billion of assets in the form of cash and liquid securities with the balance invested in accretive, Brookfield, and Oaktree funds or into direct private credit opportunities. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And I guess if I think about the capital you've invested that's longer than three years in duration, $41 billion-ish, under three years at $76 billion. So I think, large component is this year for bringing in excess fee-bearing -- our additional fee-bearing capital and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the strong performance of a number of our other complementary strategies, which, to Bruce's point, they are proving -- continuing to prove to be very attractive in this environment, given the nature of what we're investing in. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
