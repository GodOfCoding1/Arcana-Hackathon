As expected, the growth continues to be concentrated within our primary lending focus, the residential real estate portfolio, which increased by $181.8 million or 4.6% for fourth quarter of 2022 over the same period in 2021. Total average investment securities, which include the AFS AECM portfolios, remained stable, increasing $2.3 million during the fourth quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009922 over the third quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009922. As a result, we held an average of $669 million of overnight investments during the fourth quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009922, a decrease of $454 million compared to the same period in 2021. On the funding side of the balance sheet, total average deposits decreased $25.4 million or 0.5% for the fourth quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009922 over the same period a year earlier. As we move into 2023, the bank has approximately $211 million of CDs that will mature at an average rate of 22 basis points in the first quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009923.

Total non-interest expense net of ROE expense came in at $26.3 million, up $284,000 compared to the third quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and slightly over our estimated range of $24.9 million to $25.5 million."
