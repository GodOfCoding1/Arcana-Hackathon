    "content": " With regard to earnings on our linked quarter basis, our net income was $128 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. And that's compared with the $122 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of $6.2 or 5% Our net income for dilutive common share was a $1.40 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared with the $1.33 for the three months ended March 2022. With regard to loans, loans on June 30, 2022, were $18.2 billion, a decrease of $1 billion, or 5.4%, compared with $19 billion on June 30, 2021, primarily due to decreases in warehouse purchase program, PPP loans, and structured commercial real estate loans. Excluding the warehouse purchase program and the PPP loans, loans on June 30, 2022 were $17 billion compared to $16.4 billion on June 30, 2021, an increase of $667 million or 4.1%. Our linked quarter loans, excluding warehouse purchase program, and PPP loans, increased $406 million or 2.4%, 9.8% annualized. Our deposits on June 30, 2022 were $29.9 billion, an increase of $755 million, or 2.6%, compared with the $29.1 billion on June 30, 2021. With regard to asset quality, our non-performing assets totaled $22 million or seven basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets on June 30, 2022. And that was compared with $33 million or 11 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets on June 30, 2021, a 34% Decrease in non-performing assets. Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $248.5 million, compared to $245.4 million for the same period in 2021, an increase of $3.1 million or 1.3%. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 2.97% for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to 3.11% for the same period in 2021 and 2.88% for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Non-interest income was $37.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to $35.6 million for the same period in 2021, and $35.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Non-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $122.9 million compared to $115.2 million for the same period in 2021 and $119.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Our non-performing assets at quarter end June 30, 2022, total $22,187,000 or 12 basis points of loans and other real estate, compared to $27,184,000 or 15 basis points at March 31, 2022. You may now go ahead. So this was isolated to the public funds side, I think just in non-interest bearing, demand deposits to loans grew $255 million for the quarter. But overall, if you're looking at, we're going to still see increase in net interest, income and margin in the third quarter, but it might be a little bit less than what we saw, second quarter just because of the impact of the deposits. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. You may now go ahead. I think one thing you may see Abraham is the, in the earlier days before interest rates went to zero, banks like us had maybe 20%, 20% Plus, and their certificates and time deposits were now we're under 10%. You may now go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. Hey, good morning, guys."
