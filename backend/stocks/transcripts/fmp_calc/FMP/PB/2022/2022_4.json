While the net interest margin at some banks has improved immediately because of higher rates, we expect Prosperity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net interest margin to continue to increase over the next several years as our bond portfolio, which yielded 1.96% during the fourth quarter of 2022, reprices to higher yields assuming that rates normalize near the current rate, Overall, we are excited about the growth and future of our company.

I would -- it's hard for me to say that we would grow 2%, because -- just because of the interest rates, some of the rates other banks are paying are pretty high and we haven't chased the rates, so normally I would just -- I would always tell you it's the lay down that we're going to be 2% to 4% organically. So you see some depositors some -- I think it's really some of your bigger depositor like I watched I was in a trust committee meeting day before yesterday, and I saw where this customer could add $15 million with us in the bank, but he moved it over to our trust department because our trust department was hiring another higher rate from a Goldman Sachs or something like that. It's these small towns where we have really big market shares and granular portfolios where we're getting pressure or people that ask us to come off of our rate sheets tends to be from professionally managed money, bigger company that's got $50 million, $60 million, $70 million in the bank that's got a CFO that's keeping track of things and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n And we can count those on our hands."
