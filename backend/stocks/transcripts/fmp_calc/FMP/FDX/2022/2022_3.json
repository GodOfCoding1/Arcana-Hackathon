    "content": " FedEx Freight once again delivered strong results with third quarter operating income nearly tripling year-over-year, driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. In the third quarter, revenue growth was 10% year-over-year, with double-digit yield improvement for FedEx Express and FedEx Freight, close behind with FedEx Ground at 9% year-over-year yield improvement. The implications from the Omicron variant surge reduced third quarter operating income by an estimated $350 million, predominantly at Express, as it influenced customer demand and pressured our operations, resulting in constrained capacity, network disruptions and lower volumes and revenue. Freight had another outstanding quarter, delivering an operating margin of 15%, 850 basis points higher year-over-year and revenue for the third quarter increased 23% with operating income up over 180% despite the pressures from higher purchase transportation rates and wages."
