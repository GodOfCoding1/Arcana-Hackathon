    "content": " And Mike, just related to that, if the company is asking investors to gain confidence in multiyear targets, I think it would be helpful to have some goalposts here and now, around 2023, around what underpins the 15% EPS growth in 2023, with respect to ground margins and express margins, hopefully, I don't know if you guys are willing to engage with that question. But it seems like you've had a coming out of that maybe a week ago, a big capital and return focus, the involvement of an activist, you've now talked about lowering CapEx, maybe talk about what's getting removed from the CapEx or how your thoughts on investment shifts from your prior kind of growth focus and how we should think about that, obviously, you've built a huge cash balance now and maybe talk about your thoughts on capital allocation and distribution going forward. And Scott, yes, you're definitely not going to get me to give away the story for next week today, but I'll just tell you this much that, historically, express focus on time definite services, ground focused on day different services, and it's fantastic that we actually gained a lot of share in the U.S. domestic market over the last 20 years."
