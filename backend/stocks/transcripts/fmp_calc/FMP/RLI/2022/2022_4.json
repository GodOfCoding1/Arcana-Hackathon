    "content": " Realized losses of $3 million in the quarter were the result of adjustments to Maui Jim's pre-close financials, which increased our equity in Maui earnings and correspondingly decreased on realized gain recorded on the sale. Year-to-date, property's underlying loss ratio declined 4 points compared to last year, due lower attritional losses in both inland marine and commercial fired, while casualties declined one point aided by the shift in mix of -- in business mix and overall rate increases. As our property per risk treaty has done loss impacted over the last few years, we renewed it with an estimated 40% risk-adjusted rate increase, an increase to first dollar retention to $2 million. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And Jen's comment, I mean, was actually going to sort of be my next question was, are you seeing any evidence that customers are basically doing what you did in raising retentions and lowering -- changing their limit strategy such that -- I mean I know from your perspective, you might be getting whatever a 20% rate increase, but in fact, the actual amount of premium growth would be considerably smaller than that. Your line is now open."
