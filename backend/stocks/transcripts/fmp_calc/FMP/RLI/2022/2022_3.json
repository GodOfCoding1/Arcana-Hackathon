    "content": " From an underwriting income perspective, the quarter's combined ratio was 97% compared to 94.6% a year ago. Net of bonus related impacts, the event totaled $34.8 million or $0.60 per share net of tax and added 12 points to the quarter's combined ratio. Although the property segment reported a 110% combined ratio in quarter, it was an improvement from last year's third quarter and the segment is on pace to outperform last year's results was an excellent 82% combined ratio year-to-date. Our Transportation Group experienced 10% growth in the quarter, which was driven by the public auto product, which continues to see more buses in service compared to last year's third quarter. This is the season of meeting with reinsurers, so we went to a number of meetings, we've been doing some traveling, and the reinsurance market is looking to take some action here from a rate standpoint, and also push on other terms and conditions such as retention by that pitch, because we would like to continue to take advantage of this market, I think you can see from our results in 2022, that, despite we had a lot of growth, we had a large event, but we were still able to make an underwriting profit year-to-date in our EMS division."
