    "content": " We delivered an 8.1% adjusted operating margin, increased revenue by $1.5 billion to $3.9 billion and gross profit by $288 million to $768 million and drove F&I gross profit per vehicle to $2,480, up $569 from prior year. Overall, compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted net income increased 43% to $205 million, and adjusted EPS increased 25% to $9.23. We still have ways to go on the acquisitions, but we think when the margins come back to whatever they end up back at, if that's \u00e2\u0080\u009824, \u00e2\u0080\u009823 or \u00e2\u0080\u009824, we're kind of in that 60% range for SG&A percentage of gross to low 60%, but also there's some potential to be able to bring that number back down into that mid-50s range. And when you look at a couple of the import brands that represent 25% of our import business that we never had a five-day supply of cars in the quarter, that's why you're seeing such strong margins. So the demand is still there, and I can't stress enough point on the script, with the average age of the car around 12-years, there's just that natural attrition or benefit that we're going to have it even whatever headwinds come our way, we feel like that we'll maintain better than most sectors. I think what's been consistent through the quarters, which has been a little bit surprising to me, is that north of 90% of the customers that have purchased live in our communities, but haven't done business with our stores. I would say, going forward for the next few years, because of the average age of the car being over 12-years and the pent-up demand that's there and we're still selling over 25% of our inventory before it ever gets here."
