    "content": " Delivered an 8.5% adjusted operating margin, increased revenue by $1.4 billion to $4 billion and increased gross profit by $305 million to $803 million, and drove F&I gross profit per vehicle to $2,390, up . At the end of June, our total new vehicle inventory was $238 million and our day supply was at 13 days, down four days from the prior year quarter. Our total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $425 million, which represents a 34-day supply down 3 days from the prior year. Overall, compared to the same quarter last year, adjusted net income increased 47% to two $223 million, and adjusted EPS increased 29% to $10.04. Year to date, we generated adjusted operating cash flow of $544 million, which combined with proceeds from the invested stores allowed pay down $487 million of debt and our used vehicle volume and repurchased 200 million in shares. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of liquidity comprised of cash excluding cash to Total Care Auto, floorplan offset accounts, and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility. We think over the next few years we have an opportunity to bring it down over time, but the age old supply and demand retaining margins I would say this, I've said it in past quarters, so I'm going to stay consistent with it, even if inventories normalize and we get back to a pre-pandemic inventory levels, you won't see us get back to pre-pandemic margins or I shouldn't say margins, gross profits per vehicles. I think it will always move around a little bit depending upon the spread of the brand mix, and how much of it is newly used, but again, and I don't know if our peers are quoting any numbers, but to be over 2,100 a car in F&I with the consumer self-selecting compared to 2,400 with us selling the product face to face, we think that's really strong."
