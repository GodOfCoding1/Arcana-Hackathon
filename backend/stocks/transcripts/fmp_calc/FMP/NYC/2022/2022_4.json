    "content": " I will now turn the call over to Michael Weil, Chief Executive Officer of American Strategic Investment Co. Today, we'll discuss the improved results recorded for the fourth quarter and our full year 2022. At year-end, our $841.1 million, 1.2 million square foot portfolio had occupancy of 82.7% and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.1 years. In 2022, we completed nine new leases totalling 58,200 square feet and we have a forward pipeline of leases and expansions that total over 26,000 square feet and approximately $1.1 million of annualized straight line rent. As you may recall from last year, revenue in 2021 for the fourth quarter and full year benefited from over $9 million of income from termination fees and accelerated amortization of remaining unamortized balance of below market lease liabilities, which was recorded as revenue. Cash NOI for the full year was $26.9 million and was $8 million in the fourth quarter, a 10% increase compared to the full year of 2021 and a 13% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2021."
