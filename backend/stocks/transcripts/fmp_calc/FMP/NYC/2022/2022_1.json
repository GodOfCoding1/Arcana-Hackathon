    "content": " I'm excited about the value-generating opportunities that we see in New York City REIT, starting with the collection of nearly 100% of cash rent across our portfolio in the first quarter and supported by our effective proactive asset and property management strategy, which resulted in portfolio occupancy growth of 1.5% to 84.4% at quarter end. We've continued to drive New York City REIT forward this quarter, negotiating leases with new and existing tenants and growing rent collection across the portfolio. With a 71.8% total return since the beginning of 2021 and based on our current trading price, we believe that our shareholders are well positioned to benefit from the ongoing progress towards pre-pandemic activity in New York City and the hard work of our dedicated team."
