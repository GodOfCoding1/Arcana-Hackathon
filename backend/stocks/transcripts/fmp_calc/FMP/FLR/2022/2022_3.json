    "content": " New awards for the quarter include a $4.5 billion 4-year extension with the U.S Department of Energy for the Fluor-led Savannah River Nuclear Solutions LLC, management and operations contract near Aiken, South Carolina. For the first -- for the third quarter of 2022, revenue of $3.6 billion increased from the ramp-up of execution activities on refinery projects in Mexico, a recently awarded reimbursable LNG project and the chemicals project David mentioned. But having said all that, from our perspective and talking to our clients and looking at their CapEx plans, they're generally speaking, if you take kind of a sample of some of our key clients across the three business segments, the CapEx plans are generally heading up from 117 take the top 10 clients $175 billion in '22, up to $195 billion in 2023. So these are decade-long decisions on the projects we work on and not really impacted by a temporary slowdown or recession, economic activity might -- our Head of Strategy was telling us that a recent conference board, CEO survey, 136 CEOs, 98% of them are planning on a recession in the next 12 to 18 months, but 86% of them said that they're maintaining or increasing capital spending. First question, just trying to understand what drives the sequential revenue increase from Q4 to Q3, the $4 billion plus and what's implied in the operating margin in Urban Solutions just because that market has -- the margins in that business have been challenged."
