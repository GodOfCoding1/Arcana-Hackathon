    "content": " These types of projects, whether it's, there's many, many places where clients are looking to move into energy transition, it could be energy storage, where we have work, we have worked in blue and green hydrogen, renewable fuels, biofuels, renewable jet fuel, obviously, our carbon capture, we have differentiated ourselves there with our proprietary pre and post combustion technologies. The battery value chain, we're participating including the award in China, I mentioned here just in Q2, green ammonia, decarbonization and electrification of facilities, chemical recycling, and of course, we're going to be participating on the front end of these new small modular reactor programs with new scale both in Idaho and Romania to get started so I think - we don't want to win on price we don't have to win on price."
