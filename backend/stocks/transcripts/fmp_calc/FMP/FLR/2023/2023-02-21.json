    "content": " Just over two years ago, together with the new senior management team we launched the strategy for the company that centered around four overarching priorities: First, driving growth across our portfolio by growing markets outside of the traditional oil and gas sector, including energy transition, chemicals, advanced technology and life sciences, high demand metals, infrastructure and our solutions for government clients. Our guidance for 2023 and 2026 are based on: first, the significant volume of new awards received across all three segments over the past year; second, the reimbursable concentration of contracts and the underlying quality of the existing backlog; third, a diverse and robust prospect pipeline; and fourth, the timely close out of our remaining legacy projects. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Well, I don't know if I want to give guidance around the new awards, but let's say, it's definitely north of $10 billion in upcoming years relative to being able to support that 2023 and beyond -- 2024 and beyond targets."
